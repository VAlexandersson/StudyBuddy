      "QUERY: what is the name of the muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach and does any chemical digestion occur there\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_21\n",
      "The esophagus is a muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach. No chemical digestion occurs while the bolus is mechanically propelled through this tube by peristalsis.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_18\n",
      "The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\n",
      "The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication (chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\n",
      "Food (now called a bolus since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\n",
      "Figure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\n",
      "Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\n",
      "Figure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\n",
      "In chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\n",
      "Video: Enzyme Action and the Hydrolysis of Sucrose by McGraw-Hill Animations, YouTube (June 3, 2017). 1:46 minutes.\n",
      "Nutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen (or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\n",
      "In excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_17\n",
      "The function of the digestive system is to break down the foods you eat, release their nutrients, and absorb those nutrients into the body. Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital contribution to this process.\n",
      "The easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories: the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs.\n",
      "* The GI tract is a one-way tube about 25 feet in length, beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. Between these two points, the GI tract also contains the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and the rectum. The small intestine is comprised of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The large intestine, also called the colon, is similarly divided into three sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. Both the mouth and anus are open to the external environment; thus, food and wastes within the GI tract are technically considered to be outside the body. Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body’s “inner space.”\n",
      "* Accessory organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. They are considered accessory organs since they are not actually part of the intestinal tract itself, but have ducts that deliver digestive juices into the tract to help aid in digestion. There are four accessory organs: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. All of these organs secrete fluids containing a variety of chemicals such as enzymes and acids that aid in digestion.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_202\n",
      "The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach from the esophagus. As illustrated in the image below, both mechanical and chemical digestion take place in the stomach. The stomach releases gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate the chemical digestion of protein. Muscular contractions, called peristalsis, also aid in digestion. The powerful stomach contractions churn the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture, which is called chyme.\n",
      "Fig. 6.18. Protein digestion in the stomach\n",
      "Because of the hydrochloric acid in the stomach, it has a very low pH of 1.5-3.5. The acidity of the stomach causes food proteins to denature, unfolding their three-dimensional structure to reveal just the polypeptide chain. This is the first step of chemical digestion of proteins. Recall that the three-dimensional structure of a protein is essential to its function, so denaturation in the stomach also destroys protein function. (This is why a protein such as insulin can’t be taken as an oral medication. Its function is destroyed in the digestive tract, first by denaturation and then further by enzymatic digestion. Instead, it has to be injected so that it is absorbed intact into the bloodstream.)\n",
      "Fig. 6.19. In the stomach, proteins are denatured because of the acidity of hydrochloric acid.\n",
      "Once proteins are denatured in the stomach, the peptide bonds linking amino acids together are more accessible for enzymatic digestion. That process is started by pepsin, an enzyme that is secreted by the cells that line the stomach and is activated by hydrochloric acid. Pepsin begins breaking peptide bonds, creating shorter polypeptides.\n",
      "Fig. 6.20. Enzymatic digestion of proteins begins in the stomach with the action of the enzyme pepsin. \n",
      "Proteins are large globular molecules, and their chemical breakdown requires time and mixing. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion. Eating a high-protein meal increases the amount of time required to sufficiently break down the meal in the stomach. Food remains in the stomach longer, making you feel full longer.\n",

      "Most of the nutrients from the peanut butter and jelly sandwich have now been digested and absorbed. Any components that still remain (usually less than ten percent of food consumed) and the indigestible fiber move from the small intestine to the large intestine (colon). A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the remaining water. Water is present not only from the solid foods and beverages consumed, but also the digestive juices released by the stomach and pancreas. As water is reabsorbed, liquid chyme becomes a semisolid, referred to as feces. Feces is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested substances, millions of bacteria, old cells from the lining of the GI tract, inorganic salts, and enough water to let it pass smoothly out of the body.\n",
      "Feces is stored in the rectum (a temporary holding area) until it is expelled through the anus via defecation. No further chemical breakdown of food takes place in the large intestine except that accomplished by the bacteria that inhabit this portion of the GI tract. There are trillions of bacteria residing in the large intestine (referred to as the bacterial flora), exceeding the total number of cells in the human body. This may seem rather unpleasant, but the great majority of bacteria in the large intestine are harmless and many are even beneficial—facilitating chemical digestion and absorption, improving immune function, and synthesizing vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K.\n",

      "Maltose is made of two glucose molecules bonded together. It doesn’t occur naturally in any appreciable amount in foods, with one exception: sprouted grains. Grains contain a lot of starch, which is made of long chains of glucose (more on this in a minute), and when the seed of a grain starts to sprout, it begins to break down that starch, creating maltose. If bread is made from those sprouted grains, that bread will have some maltose. Sprouted grain bread is usually a little heavier and sweeter than bread made from regular flour.\n",
      "Maltose also plays a role in the production of beer and liquor, because this process involves the fermentation of grains or other carbohydrate sources. Maltose is formed during the breakdown of those carbohydrates, but there is very little remaining once the fermentation process is complete.\n",
      "You can taste the sweetness of maltose if you hold a starchy food in your mouth for a minute or so. Try this with a simple food like a soda cracker. Starch is not sweet, but as the starch in the cracker begins to break down with the action of salivary amylase, maltose will form, and you’ll taste the sweetness!\n",

      "QUERY: what is the name of the hormone secreted by adipose tissue that helps regulate appetite and how does it work\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_119\n",
      "Fats help the body to produce and regulate hormones. For example, adipose tissue secretes the hormone leptin, which signals the body’s energy status and helps to regulate appetite. Fat is also required for reproductive health; a woman who lacks adequate amounts may stop menstruating and be unable to conceive until her body can store more energy as fat. Omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids help regulate cholesterol and blood clotting and control inflammation in the joints, tissues, and bloodstream. Fats also play important functional roles in sustaining nerve impulse transmission, memory storage, and tissue structure. Lipids are especially focal to brain activity in structure and in function, helping to form nerve cell membranes, insulate neurons, and facilitate the signaling of electrical impulses throughout the brain.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_232\n",
      "Given the importance of energy’s role in sustaining life, it’s not surprising that energy balance is tightly regulated by complex physiological processes. A region in the brain called the hypothalamus is the main control center for hunger and satiety. There is a constant dialogue between our brains and gastrointestinal tracts through hormonal and neural signals, which determine if we feel hungry or full. The hypothalamus can sense nutrient levels in the blood, and when nutrient levels are low, the hunger center is stimulated. Conversely, when nutrient levels are high, the satiety center is stimulated.\n",
      "Figure 7.6. The hypothalamus, shown in blue, is about the size of an almond and serves as the hunger center of the brain, receiving signals from the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, and blood and signaling hunger and satiety.\n",
      "Hunger is the physiological need to eat. When the stomach is empty, it contracts and starts to grumble and growl. The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus. (Of course, the stomach also contracts when it’s full and hard at work digesting food, but we can’t hear these movements as well because the stomach’s contents muffle the noise.) The stomach is also the main organ that produces and secretes the “hunger hormone,” ghrelin, the only gut hormone found to increase hunger. Ghrelin levels are high before a meal and fall quickly once nutrients are absorbed.3\n",
      "Appetite is the psychological desire to eat. Satiety is the sensation of feeling full. After you eat a meal, the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. There are many hormones that are associated with satiety, and various organs secrete these hormones, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an example of one of these satiety hormones and is secreted in response to nutrients in the gut, especially fat and protein. In addition to inhibiting food intake, CCK stimulates pancreatic secretions, gall bladder contractions, and intestinal motility—all of which aide in the digestion of nutrients.3\n",
      "Adipose tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Adipose is the primary organ that produces the hormone leptin, and as fat stores increase, more leptin is produced. Higher levels of leptin communicate to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. Leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked excitement in the research world and the weight loss industry, as it was hypothesized that leptin might be used as a weight loss drug to decrease food intake. In several clinical trials, it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it. Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person, there is generally no sustained effect on food intake.4\n",
      "Figure 7.7. The structure of the hormone leptin (left), which is primarily produced by adipose tissue. The obese mouse in the photo has a gene mutation that makes it unable to produce leptin, resulting in constant hunger, lethargy, and severe obesity. For comparison, a mouse with normal leptin production is also shown. Such gene mutations are rare, but they serve as a dramatic illustration of the importance of the hormone in signaling energy balance.\n",

      "A tissue is a group of many similar cells that share a common structure and work together to perform a specific function. There are four basic types of human tissues: connective tissue, which connects tissues; epithelial tissue, which lines and protects organs; muscle, which contracts for movement and support; and nerve, which responds and reacts to signals in the environment.\n",
      "An organ is a group of similar tissues arranged in a specific manner to perform a specific physiological function. Examples include the brain, liver, and heart. An organ systemis a group of two or more organs that work together to perform a specific physiological function. Examples include the digestive system and central nervous system.\n",
      "There are eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (Figure 3.3). Assigning organs to organ systems can be imprecise since organs that “belong” to one system can also have functions integral to another system. In fact, many organs contribute to more than one system. And most of these organ systems are involved in nutrition-related functions within the body (Table 3.1). For example, the cardiovascular system plays a role in nutrition by transporting nutrients in the blood to the cells of the body. The endocrine system produces hormones, many of which are involved in regulating appetite, digestive processes, and nutrient levels in the blood. Even the reproductive system plays a role in providing nutrition to a developing fetus or growing baby.\n",

      "The excess energy from the food we eat is incorporated into adipose tissue, or fatty tissue. Most of the energy required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates unit, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of energy, it is quite bulky with heavy water content, so the body cannot store much of it for long. Fats, on the other hand, can serve as a larger and more long-term energy reserve. Fats pack together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with energy, containing more than double the amount of energy as a gram of carbohydrate.\n",
      "We draw on the energy stored in fat to help meet our basic energy needs when we’re at rest and to fuel our muscles for movement throughout the day, from walking to class, playing with our kids, dancing through dinner prep, or powering through a shift at work. Historically, when humans relied on hunting and gathering wild foods or on the success of agricultural crops, having the ability to store energy as fat was vital to survival through lean times. Hunger remains a problem for people around the world, and being able to store energy when times are good can help them endure a period of food insecurity. In other cases, the energy stored in adipose tissue might allow a person to weather a long illness.\n",
      "Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost indefinitely in size. An overabundance of adipose tissue can be detrimental to your health not only from mechanical stress on the body due to excess weight, but also from hormonal and metabolic changes. Obesity can increase the risk for many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and certain types of cancer. It can also interfere with reproduction, cognitive function, and mood. Thus, while some body fat is critical to our survival and good health, in large quantities it can be a deterrent to maintaining good health.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_382\n",
      "Fluoride is a trace mineral needed in very small amounts in the body. It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn’t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride’s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\n",
      "Fluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\n",
      "* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\n",
      "* Preventing demineralization of teeth\n",
      "* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\n",
      "As a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\n",
      "Fluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water.\n",

      "* Obesity\n",
      "* Type 2 diabetes\n",
      "* Some cancers\n",
      "* Dental cavities\n",
      "Why does too much added sugar cause health problems? The reasons are complex, and this is an ongoing area of research and controversy. One possible explanation is that a diet high in added sugar means the pancreas has to work hard to make enough insulin, and over time, it can begin to fail and the body’s cells start to become insulin resistant. The liver also has to work hard to metabolize fructose, and too much fructose increases fat synthesis, which can raise blood lipid and cholesterol levels, increasing risk of heart disease.\n",
      "Both dietary sucrose and starch are associated with tooth decay. Bacteria living in the mouth can utilize the carbohydrates passing through the oral cavity for their own benefit. Those bacteria happily metabolize carbohydrates, especially sucrose, but also starchy foods, which stick to teeth and linger there. Acid is formed in the process, and this can dissolve your tooth enamel, eventually causing cavities, also known as dental caries. Reducing sugar intake, limiting between-meal snacks, and brushing after meals to remove lingering carbohydrates can help reduce the risk of dental caries. The use of fluoride and regular dental care also help.\n",
      "Fig. 4.36. Dental caries are formed because of a combination of factors: the presence of oral bacteria; a supply of sugar and/or starch for them to eat; tooth surface where they can form colonies, or plaque; and time.\n",

      "However, as with all minerals, fluoride can also be quite toxic if consumed in excessive amounts. Acute toxicity symptoms from large intakes of fluoride include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity results in an irreversible condition known as fluorosis, characterized by the mottling (i.e., white speckling) and pitting of the teeth (see Figure 9.10). Fluorosis is primarily a risk in children, because mineralization of permanent teeth has typically occurred by age 8.6\n",

In communities without fluoridated water, intake depends on how much fluoride occurs naturally in the water, but in most areas, natural levels fall below amounts recommended for cavity prevention. Other beverages with a high amount of fluoride include teas and grape juice. Solid foods do not generally contain a large amount of fluoride, although this depends on the fluoride level of the soil and water it was grown in and whether it was cooked with fluoridated water. Canned meats and fish that contain bones do contain some fluoride. Other good non-dietary sources are fluoridated toothpaste and dental rinses.\n",

      "Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.\n",
      "In dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.\n",
      "Vitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations—chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person’s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\n",
      "Recall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we’ll discuss later on this page.\n",
      "Figure 9.11. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin (vitamin D3) or provided in the diet (vitamin D2 or D3). It is converted by reactions occurring first in the liver (making calcidiol) and then kidney (making calcitriol, the active form). Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.\n",
      "Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1\n",

      "QUERY: what is the recommended daily intake of protein for athletes and how does this compare to the rda for sedentary adults\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_193\n",
      "Because our bodies are so efficient at recycling amino acids, protein needs are not as high as carbohydrate and fat needs. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for a sedentary adult is 0.8 g per kg body weight per day. This would mean that a 165-pound man and a 143-pound woman would need 60 g and 52 g of protein per day, respectively. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is 10% to 35% of total energy intake. A Tolerable Upper Intake Limit for protein has not been set, but it is recommended that you not exceed the upper end of the AMDR.\n",
      "Protein needs are higher for the following populations:\n",
      "* growing children and adolescents\n",
      "* women who are pregnant (they’re using protein to help grow a fetus)\n",
      "* lactating women (breast milk has protein in it for the baby’s nutrition, so mothers need more protein to synthesize that milk)\n",
      "* athletes\n",
      "The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day for athletes, depending on the type of training.1 Higher intakes may be needed for short periods during intensified training or with reduced energy intake.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_444\n",
      "Although protein accounts for only about 5% of energy expended, dietary protein is necessary to support metabolic reactions that generate ATP, which rely heavily on proteins such as enzymes and transport proteins. Additional protein also helps muscles with maintenance, growth, and repair. For these reasons, athletes have higher protein needs than the general population. It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\n",
      "It is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body’s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\n",
      "In addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g/kg/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g/kg/day for muscle synthesis.3\n",
      "Although athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements. Here are some examples of snacks or small meals that contain at least 15 to 25 grams of protein4:\n",
      "* ½ cup of granola plus ¼ cup almonds (16 grams protein)\n",
      "* 7 oz. Greek yogurt (20 grams protein)\n",
      "* Peanut butter sandwich (20 grams protein)\n",
      "* 2 scrambled eggs and 1 cup of milk (20 grams protein)\n",
      "* 3 oz. canned tuna (½ can) with ½ cup crackers (22 grams protein)\n",
      "* Turkey and cheese sandwich (32 grams protein)\n",
      "These whole food options have the benefit of coming packaged with other nutrients, including carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, fiber, and micronutrients, and are often less costly than most protein supplements. Like all dietary supplements, protein shakes and other supplements are not well-regulated; some contain unnecessary additives such as sweeteners and herbs, and some have been found to contain unsafe levels of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury. Protein supplements do have the benefit of being convenient and shelf-stable. If you choose to use a protein supplement, look for one certified by a third-party testing organization and with a simple ingredient list.5\n",

      "A healthy diet incorporates all nutrients in moderation, meaning that there’s neither too little nor too much. As with all nutrients, having too little or too much protein can have health consequences.\n",
      "The AMDR for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent of kilocalories.1 That’s a fairly wide range, and it encompasses typical protein intakes of many traditional human cultures.\n",
      "Fig. 6.22. Diverse human cultures have survived on different levels of dietary protein. The photo on the left shows Inuit families sharing frozen, aged walrus meat. Their traditional diet is very dependent on meat and high in both protein and fat. On the right is a traditional vegetarian meal in India, high in carbohydrates but still providing adequate levels of protein. \n",
      "Protein intake below the RDA is inadequate to support the body’s needs for synthesis of structural and functional proteins. On the other hand, there are some concerns that high protein intake is associated with chronic disease. However, as we’ll discuss, it’s not just the quantity of protein that matters, but also the nutritional package that it comes in.\n",
      "According to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, most Americans get enough protein, averaging about 88 grams per day and 14 to 16 percent of caloric intake. The study also found that diets with protein above 35 percent of caloric intake, the upper end of the AMDR, were extremely rare.2\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_210\n",
      "When the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine wrote the DRI for macronutrients, published in 2005, they concluded that there wasn’t enough evidence to establish an Upper Limit for protein. The high end of the AMDR, 35 percent of kilocalories for protein, was set in order to allow the total diet to be well-balanced with carbohydrate and fat.1 Higher levels of protein intake haven’t been well-studied, but over the years, there have been many concerns with high protein diets. However, current evidence indicates it’s large amounts of animal protein (particularly from red meat or processed meats) that can be problematic, not high amounts of protein per se.5\n",
      "For example, a diet containing lots of steak, bacon, and sausage would be high in protein, but it also might be high in saturated fat, cholesterol, salt, and nitrates. Eating more red meat and processed red meat is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer (especially colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and breast cancers). This link doesn’t seem to be caused by the protein but rather the nutritional package that it comes in. In addition, the link to cancer may be related to the carcinogens that can form when meat is cooked at high temperatures, particularly when it’s charred by grilling.5\n",
      "On the other hand, studies show that when protein comes from lean meat and plant sources, risk of chronic diseases may be reduced. For example, a 2015 study found that frequent consumption of red meat in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer later in life, whereas consuming poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts instead lowered risk.6 Other studies have shown that higher protein diets can reduce the risk of heart disease, provided the protein comes from healthier sources.\n",
      "Fig. 6.24. Compare several different “protein packages.” The steak and bacon provide protein but also large amounts of saturated fat and sodium. Salmon provides as much protein as the steak but with less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fats. Lentils are a good source of protein, are low in fat, and are a great source of fiber. \n",
      "Several other concerns about high protein diets haven’t turned out to be problematic after all:\n",
      "* Osteoporosis – High protein diets were once thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis, because researchers noticed that urinary calcium excretion increases when people consume high amounts of protein. However, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation found that this is not a concern, and some studies even show that higher protein intake is associated with greater bone mineral density.7\n",
      "* Kidney function – Another concern was that high protein diets would strain the kidneys because of the increased need to filter and excrete nitrogen. A 2018 meta-analysis concluded that this is not a concern. However, people who already have chronic kidney disease should avoid high protein diets and maintain protein intake around the RDA of 0.8 g/kg, a lower intake than many Americans are consuming.8 A 2009 study tested a very low protein diet of 0.6 g/kg protein per day in people with chronic kidney disease and found that it did not prevent the development of kidney failure but did increase the risk of death, underscoring the importance of adequate protein even in people with kidney disease.9\n",
      "From all of this research, there’s little evidence that a high protein diet is inherently harmful, so long as the protein doesn’t come packaged with a lot of saturated fat and red meat consumption is limited. Still, there’s little research directly testing the health effects of very high protein diets, including those achieved using protein supplements of purified protein, so it’s probably wise to keep protein balanced with the other macronutrients, focusing on whole foods from all the food groups.\n",

      "The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When amino acids are broken down, nitrogen is released. Most nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, but some urea is also contained in feces. Nitrogen is also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to balance the amount of protein used by the body, measured as the amount of nitrogen lost from the body. The Institute Of Medicine used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein.\n",
      "* Nitrogen Balance– A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen consumed equals the amount of nitrogen excreted. Most healthy adults are in nitrogen balance. If more protein is consumed than needed, this extra protein is used for energy, and the nitrogen waste that results is excreted. The lowest amount of protein a person can consume and still remain in nitrogen balance represents that person’s minimum protein requirement.\n",
      "Figure 6.14. People are in nitrogen balance when they excrete as much nitrogen as they consume.\n",
      "* Negative Nitrogen Balance– A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who is eating a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than they actually need.\n",
      "Figure 6.15. People are in negative nitrogen balance when they excrete more nitrogen than they consume, usually because they are not eating enough protein to meet their needs.\n",
      "* Positive Nitrogen Balance– A person is in positive nitrogen balance when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during pregnancy or growth in childhood. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.\n",
      "Figure 6.16. People are in positive nitrogen balance when they excrete less nitrogen than they consume, because they are using protein to actively build new tissue.\n",

The mouth and stomach play a small role in this process, but most enzymatic digestion of lipids happens in the small intestine.

      "DOCUMENT: ns_134\n",
      "Fatty acid chains are composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms that are bonded to each other. The term “saturation” refers to whether the carbon atom in a fatty acid chain is filled (or “saturated”) to capacity with hydrogen atoms. In a saturated fatty acid, each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, with single bonds between the carbons.\n",
      "Alternatively, fatty acids can have points where hydrogen atoms are missing, because there is a double bond between carbons (C=C). This is referred to as a point of unsaturation, because the carbon is only bonded to one hydrogen atom instead of two. Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more points of unsaturation, or double bonds between the carbons. A monounsaturated fatty acid is a fatty acid with one double bond, and a polyunsaturated fatty acid is a fatty acid with two or more double bonds.\n",

      "Triglycerides in food contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, but some foods are better sources of these types of fatty acids than others (Figure 5.13). For example, coconut oil is very high in saturated fat, but it still contains some monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Peanut oil is often thought of as a good source of monounsaturated fat, because that is the predominant fatty acid in the oil, but peanut oil also contains a fair amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids and even some saturated fatty acids.\n",

      "Being conscious of the need to reduce blood cholesterol levels to improve health often means limiting the consumption of saturated fats. Multiple studies have shown an association between the saturated fats found in some meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and tropical oils (coconut and palm oils) and higher LDL cholesterol levels. However, while saturated fats have a historical reputation for being unhealthy, more recent research has suggested that the link between saturated fat and heart disease may not be as clear cut as we once thought.\n",
      "The BMJ’s analysis on dietary fat and heart health explains the complicated relationship as such:\n",
      "> “Synergism and interactions between different components of foods together with the degree of processing and preparation or cooking methods lead to a ‘food matrix’ effect which is not captured by considering single nutrients. Different types of food that are high in saturated fats are likely to have different effects on health. For example, dairy products and processed meats, both high in saturated fats, are differentially associated with many health outcomes in prospective epidemiological studies, often in opposite directions. One explanation for this divergence is that despite their similar fat content, other components of these two food groups are associated with different health effects. For example, dairy products contain minerals such as calcium and magnesium and have probiotic features if fermented, whereas processed red meat has a high salt and preservative content.\n",
      "> \n",
      "> \n",
      "> To produce public health guidelines on which foods to eat or avoid to reduce the risk of chronic disease is complicated because dietary fats are typically mixtures of different types of fatty acids. Animal fats, for instance, are the main sources of saturated fats in many modern diets, but some animal fats are higher in monounsaturated fats than saturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils will typically contain both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in different concentrations. Hence, conclusions about the health effects of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are unlikely to consistently translate to the health effects of the fats, oils, and foods in which those fatty acids are present.”\n",
      "In an article from Tufts University Health & Nutrition Letter, Links Between Saturated Fat, Blood Cholesterol & Heart Disease Prove Complex, researcher Ronald M. Krauss, MD, said, “there is insufficient evidence from prospective epidemiological studies to conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).” Researchers state that reducing saturated fat intake may not clearly decrease CVD risk in part because people tend to replace saturated fat with processed carbohydrates. Recent studies have attempted to tease out different approaches to lowering saturated fat in the diet, showing that the types of foods used to replace saturated fat affect the risk of heart disease.\n",

      "> “Strong and consistent evidence shows that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, is associated with reduced blood levels of total cholesterol and of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Additionally, strong and consistent evidence shows that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats is associated with a reduced risk of CVD events (heart attacks) and CVD-related deaths.\n",

Consuming a diet rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fats is associated with a lower LDL cholesterol level and a lower risk of heart disease.\n",
      "Food sources of predominately monounsaturated fats include nuts and seeds like almonds, pecans, cashews, and peanuts; plant oils like canola, olive, and peanut oils; and avocados. The fat in poultry and eggs is predominantly unsaturated and contains more monounsaturated than polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n",

      "However, the evidence base for monounsaturated fats is not as strong as the evidence base for replacement with polyunsaturated fats. Evidence has also shown that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates reduces blood levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, but increases blood levels of triglycerides and reduces high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol). Replacing total fat or saturated fats with carbohydrates is not associated with reduced risk of CVD. Additional research is needed to determine whether this relationship is consistent across categories of carbohydrates (e.g., whole versus refined grains; intrinsic versus added sugars), as they may have different associations with various health outcomes. Therefore, saturated fats in the diet should be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.”\n",
      "Dr. Krauss summed up the recommendations as such: “An overall eating pattern that emphasizes whole grains rather than refined carbs such as white flour, along with foods high in polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, seeds, nuts and vegetable oils, is of more value for reducing coronary heart disease risk than simply aiming to further reduce saturated fat.”\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_146\n",
      "As the stomach contents enter the small intestine, most of the dietary lipids are undigested and clustered in large droplets. Bile, which is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts have both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, so they are attracted to both fats and water. This makes them effective emulsifiers, meaning that they break large fat globules into smaller droplets. Emulsification makes lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes by increasing the surface area for them to act (see Fig. 5.22 below).\n",
      "The pancreas secretes pancreatic lipases into the small intestine to enzymatically digest triglycerides. Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids, monoglycerides (glycerol backbone with one fatty acid still attached), and some free glycerol. Cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins do not need to be enzymatically digested (see Fig. 5.22 below).\n",

      "Next, those products of fat digestion (fatty acids, monoglycerides, glycerol, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins) need to enter into the circulation so that they can be used by cells around the body. Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.\n",
      "Figure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.\n",
      "Once inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.\n",

      "Lipid digestion and absorption pose some special challenges. Triglycerides are large molecules, and unlike carbohydrates and proteins, they’re not water-soluble. Because of this, they like to cluster together in large droplets when they’re in a watery environment like the digestive tract. The digestive process has to break those large droplets of fat into smaller droplets and then enzymatically digest lipid molecules using enzymes called lipases. The mouth and stomach play a small role in this process, but most enzymatic digestion of lipids happens in the small intestine. From there, the products of lipid digestion are absorbed into circulation and transported around the body, which again requires some special handling since lipids are not water-soluble and do not mix with the watery blood.\n",
      "Let’s start at the beginning to learn more about the path of lipids through the digestive tract.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_18\n",
      "The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\n",
      "The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication (chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\n",
      "Food (now called a bolus since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\n",
      "Figure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\n",
      "Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\n",
      "Figure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\n",
      "In chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\n",

      "Nutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen (or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\n",
      "In excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.\n",

      "Lipids are an important part of an infant’s diet. Breast milk contains about 4 percent fat, similar to whole cow’s milk. Whether breastfed or formula-fed, fat provides about half of an infant’s calories, and it serves an important role in brain development. Yet, infants are born with low levels of bile and pancreatic enzyme secretion, which are essential contributors to lipid digestion in older children and adults. So, how do babies digest all of the fat in their diet?\n",
      "Infants have a few special adaptations that allow them to digest fat effectively. First, they have plenty of lingual and gastric lipases right from birth. These enzymes play a much more important role in infants than they do in adults. Second, breast milk actually contains lipase enzymes that are activated in the baby’s small intestine. In other words, the mother makes lipases and sends them in breast milk to help her baby digest the milk fats. Amazing, right? Between increased activity of lingual and gastric lipases and the lipases contained in breast milk, young infants can efficiently digest fat and reap its nutritional value for growth and brain development. Studies show that fat digestion is more efficient in premature infants fed breast milk compared with those fed formula. Even pasteurized breast milk, as is used when breast milk is donated for feeding babies in the hospital, is a little harder to digest, because heat denatures the lipases. (Infants can still digest pasteurized breast milk and formula; they’re just less efficient at doing so and absorb less of the products of triglyceride digestion.)1\n",

      "QUERY: what are the names of the two hormones involved in blood calcium regulation and which gland produces each\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_369\n",
      "Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Most of the body’s calcium—more than 99% of it—is stored in bone, where it’s important for bone strength and structure. The remaining 1% of the body’s calcium is found in the blood and soft tissues, but it is here that calcium performs its most critical functions. For example, calcium is required for the transmission of every nerve impulse, electrical signals sent from one nerve cell to another. It’s also required for every cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. With inadequate calcium, muscles can’t relax, and instead become stiff and contract involuntarily, a condition known as tetany. Calcium also plays vital roles in blood pressure regulation, blood clotting, enzyme activation, hormone secretion, and signaling between cells.1\n",
      "The many roles of calcium around the body are critical to daily survival, so maintaining homeostasis, or a steady state, of blood calcium levels is a high priority. The body rigorously controls blood calcium levels in a very tight range. If blood calcium drops, your body initiates several mechanisms to restore homeostasis, including drawing calcium from the bone. While the calcium stored in bone is important for long-term strength and structure of bone, it also serves as a calcium reserve that can be drawn upon to support the vital functions of calcium in the body, should blood calcium drop too low.\n",
      "Two endocrine glands are key players in the regulation of blood calcium concentrations: the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It secretes a hormone called calcitonin. There are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea and located at the back of the thyroid gland. They secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n",
      "Figure 9.4. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located at the back of the neck.\n",
      "Let’s take a closer look at how the body regulates blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium concentration drops too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH then acts in several ways to increase blood calcium levels:\n",
      "1. PTH stimulates the activity of osteoclasts to release calcium from bone.\n",
      "2. PTH acts on the kidney to reduce the amount of calcium lost in the urine, returning more to circulation.\n",
      "3. PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that convert vitamin D to its active form, also called calcitriol. Activated vitamin D acts on the intestine to increase the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D also works together with PTH to stimulate release of calcium from the bone and reduce calcium loss in urine.\n",
      "Once blood calcium levels are normal, PTH levels drop, turning off all of these mechanisms of increasing calcium.\n",
      "On the other hand, if blood calcium levels become too high, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits the release of calcium from the bone and increases calcium excretion from the kidneys. These mechanisms help to restore normal blood calcium concentrations, after which calcitonin levels drop again.\n",
      "Figure 9.5. Blood calcium (Ca2+) levels are tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin.\n",
      "Through these two opposing pathways—PTH and vitamin D for raising blood calcium and calcitonin for lowering blood calcium—the body can very effectively maintain blood calcium homeostasis. This system is dependent upon stored calcium in bone, which is sacrificed when needed to ensure adequate blood calcium. In the short-term, this isn’t a problem, because bone remodeling allows you to replace calcium in the bone. However, in the long-term, inadequate dietary calcium means you continuously draw down the calcium stores in your bones, resulting in declining bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture.\n",
      "Calcium requirements are highest for children and adolescents, who are growing and building bones, and for older adults, who are losing bone density.\n",

      "Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.\n",
      "In dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.\n",
      "Vitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations—chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person’s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\n",
      "Recall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we’ll discuss later on this page.\n",
      "Figure 9.11. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin (vitamin D3) or provided in the diet (vitamin D2 or D3). It is converted by reactions occurring first in the liver (making calcidiol) and then kidney (making calcitriol, the active form). Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.\n",
      "Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1\n",

      "In the short-term, there are no obvious signs of calcium deficiency. This is because the body stores so much calcium in bones, and just 1% of total body calcium is required for daily functioning. If low blood calcium does occur, symptoms include muscle cramping, numbness and tingling in fingers, convulsions, lethargy, poor appetite, and abnormal heart rhythms. Without treatment, low blood calcium can lead to death.1\n",
      "Much more common is a long-term calcium deficiency, resulting from a continuous draw of calcium stores from the bone. This causes osteopenia, or low bone mass, which can lead to osteoporosis if untreated. Osteoporosis significantly increases a person’s risk of fractures. Nutrition surveys in the United States show that groups at greatest risk of dietary calcium inadequacy include adolescents and older adults, especially female teens and older women.1\n",
      "Too much calcium can also cause problems, although this is rarely caused by excessive intake of calcium from foods. Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland or a parathyroid tumor can cause high blood calcium, leading to calcification or hardening of blood vessels and soft tissue and the formation of kidney stones. High calcium intake from supplements has also been associated with increased risk of kidney stones, and in some studies, increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It can also cause constipation.1\n",

In addition, phosphorus (in the form of phosphate) is a component of the backbones of RNA and DNA, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and phospholipids. Phosphate also plays important roles in regulating cell signaling, enzyme activity, and acid-base balance, as well as being part of creatine phosphate, which is an energy source for muscles during exercise.1\n",
      "Because phosphorus is present with calcium in mineralized bone, it is somewhat regulated in parallel to calcium. PTH and activated vitamin D stimulate bone resorption, increasing not only blood levels of calcium, but also blood phosphate levels.

The hormone is then transported in the blood to its target cell, where it communicates a message to initiate a specific reaction or cellular process. For instance, after you eat a meal, your blood glucose levels rise. In response to the increased blood glucose, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. Insulin tells the cells of the body that glucose is available and to take it up from the blood and store it or use it for making energy or building macromolecules. A major function of hormones is to turn enzymes on and off, so some proteins can even regulate the actions of other proteins. While not all hormones are made from proteins, many of them are.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_477\n",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that babies begin eating some solid foods at 6 months while continuing to breastfeed. Other health organizations offer more flexible advice, recommending that solid foods be introduced sometime between 4 and 6 months, depending on the baby’s development, interest in eating solids, and family preferences. Regardless, most babies aren’t ready to eat solid foods before 4 months, and starting too soon may increase the risk of obesity. Yet it’s also important not to start solids too late, as beyond 6 months, breast milk alone can’t support a baby’s nutrient requirements.1\n",
      "However, as babies begin to eat solids, breast milk or formula continue to be the nutritional foundation of the diet. This period is also called complementary feeding, because solid foods are meant to complement the nutrients provided by breast milk or formula. Between 6 and 12 months, babies gradually eat more solid foods and less milk so that by 12 months, formula is no longer needed. Breastfeeding mothers may choose to wean at 12 months or continue breastfeeding as long as she and the baby like.\n",
      "Babies should be developmentally ready to eat solids before trying their first foods. A baby ready for solids should be able to do the following:1\n",
      "* Sit up without support (e.g., in a high chair or lap)\n",
      "* Open mouth for a spoonful of food and swallow it without gagging or pushing it back out\n",
      "* Reach for and grasp food or toys and bring them to his or her mouth\n",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends beginning with iron-rich foods such as pureed meat or iron-fortified cereal (e.g., rice cereal, oatmeal), as iron is usually the most limiting nutrient at this age, particularly for exclusively breastfed babies. Once these foods are introduced, others can gradually be added to the diet, introducing one at a time to keep an eye out for allergic reactions. Work up to a variety of foods from all of the food groups, as babies are willing to try just about anything at this stage, and this is an opportunity for them to learn about different flavors. You can also gradually increase texture, from pureed to mashed food, then lumpy foods to soft finger foods. By 12 months, most babies can eat most of the foods at the family table, with some modifications to avoid choking hazards.1,2\n",
      "When choosing good complementary foods, there are three main goals: (1) to meet nutrient requirements; (2) to introduce potentially allergenic foods; and (3) to support your baby in learning to eat many different flavors and textures. Parents should be sure to include the following:1,2\n",
      "* Good sources of iron and zinc, as both minerals can be limiting for breastfed infants. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified cereal. Beans, whole grains, and green vegetables add smaller amounts of iron.\n",
      "* Adequate fat to support babies’ rapid growth and brain development. Good sources include whole fat yogurt, avocado, nut butters, and olive oil for cooking vegetables. Fish is also a great food for babies, because it provides both iron and fat, and it’s a good source of omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, which support brain development.\n",
      "* A variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, so that your baby learns to like many different tastes and textures. It may take babies and toddlers 8 to 10 exposures of a new food before they learn to like it, so don’t be discouraged if your baby doesn’t like some foods right away.\n",
      "There is no need to avoid giving your baby common food allergens, such as peanut, egg, dairy, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, or tree nuts. In fact, studies indicate that introducing at least some of these foods during the first year can prevent food allergies from developing. The evidence is strongest for peanut allergy.\n",

      "In addition to its role in digestion, the GI tract serves an important immune function. Intestinal cells form the barrier between the interior of the body and the lumen, or tube, of the GI tract, which is technically outside of the body and teeming with potential pathogens. Immune tissue in the GI tract and other parts of the body produce immune cells that target foreign invaders, in part through the production of antibodies, protective proteins that bind to foreign substances. However, this function requires the immune system to accurately distinguish between normal food proteins and invading pathogens. A food allergy is what happens if the immune system mistakenly identifies a food protein as an invasive threat.\n",
      "The most common type of food allergy involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to a specific substance, orallergen. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur immediately after consuming the food (i.e., within seconds to minutes), although reactions can sometimes be delayed by two hours or more. Because an allergic reaction is caused by the immune system, it can lead to symptoms all over the body, including skin rashes; swollen lips, face, or throat; wheezing and difficulty breathing; nausea and vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; and rarely, a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction involving more than one organ system—a rash coupled with difficulty breathing, for example—is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately with epinephrine, commonly administered by injection with a device such as an EpiPen, and then person should seek immediate medical attention.1\n",

      "The most common food allergies in the U.S. are caused by proteins in peanuts, tree nuts, milk, shellfish, eggs, fish, wheat, soy and sesame.4,5 A 2019 study reported that 19% of adults in the U.S. believe they’re allergic to at least one food. After asking people about their symptoms, the researchers estimated that the true incidence of food allergies is closer to 11%, while the remaining 8% of people likely have a food intolerance.4\n",
      "Food allergies are common in children, affecting about 8% of U.S. children, although allergies can also develop later in life.5 It’s common for young children to outgrow allergies to egg, dairy, wheat, or soy, but peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are often lifelong. Recent research has found that letting babies eat common food allergens, particularly peanut products, can prevent the development of allergies, perhaps by allowing the immune system an early opportunity to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens.6\n",
      "If you think you may have a food allergy, it’s important to see an allergist to ensure you have an accurate diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed based on symptoms after consuming a food, specific IgE blood tests, and/or skin prick tests, where a tiny amount of food protein is scratched onto the skin to test for a reaction. Blood and skin tests determine whether a person is sensitized to an allergen, meaning that they’re producing IgE antibodies to the food. However, the presence of IgE antibodies doesn’t definitively mean a person has a food allergy; it’s common to have a positive IgE test but still be able to eat the food without symptoms. The gold standard test for diagnosing is an oral food challenge—consuming a small amount of the food and watching for signs of a reaction—although due to time, cost, and risk, these are not always conducted. If you are diagnosed with a food allergy, you will be counseled to strictly avoid the food and carry injectable epinephrine in case of accidental consumption.\n",

       "    'passage': 'The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\\nThe first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication\\xa0(chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\\nFood (now called a bolus\\xa0since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis\\xa0consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\\nFigure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\\nDigestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion\\xa0is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\\nFigure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\\nIn chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes\\xa0are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis\\xa0is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\\nVideo: Enzyme Action and the Hydrolysis of Sucrose by McGraw-Hill Animations, YouTube (June 3, 2017). 1:46 minutes.\\nNutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen\\xa0(or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\\nIn excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.'},\n",

Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital contribution to this process.\\nThe easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories: the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs.\\n* The GI tract\\xa0is a one-way tube about 25 feet in length, beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. Between these two points, the GI tract also contains the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and the rectum. The small intestine is comprised of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The large intestine, also called the colon, is similarly divided into three sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. Both the mouth and anus are open to the external environment; thus, food and wastes within the GI tract are technically considered to be outside the body. Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body’s “inner space.”\\n* Accessory organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. They are considered accessory organs since they are not actually part of the intestinal tract itself, but have ducts that deliver digestive juices into the tract to help aid in digestion. There are four accessory organs: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. All of these organs secrete fluids containing a variety of chemicals such as enzymes and acids that aid in digestion.\\nFigure 3.9. An overview of the organs involved in digestion.

       "    'passage': 'Given the importance of energy’s role in sustaining life, it’s not surprising that energy balance is tightly regulated by complex physiological processes. A region in the brain called the hypothalamus is the main control center for hunger and satiety. There is a constant dialogue between our brains and gastrointestinal tracts through hormonal and neural signals, which determine if we feel hungry or full. The hypothalamus can sense nutrient levels in the blood, and when nutrient levels are low, the hunger center is stimulated. Conversely, when nutrient levels are high, the satiety center is stimulated.\\nFigure 7.6. The hypothalamus, shown in blue, is about the size of an almond and serves as the hunger center of the brain, receiving signals from the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, and blood and signaling hunger and satiety.\\nHunger is the physiological need to eat. When the stomach is empty, it contracts and starts to grumble and growl. The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus. (Of course, the stomach also contracts when it’s full and hard at work digesting food, but we can’t hear these movements as well because the stomach’s contents muffle the noise.) The stomach is also the main organ that produces and secretes the “hunger hormone,” ghrelin, the only gut hormone found to increase hunger. Ghrelin levels are high before a meal and fall quickly once nutrients are absorbed.3\\nAppetite is the psychological desire to eat. Satiety is the sensation of feeling full. After you eat a meal, the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. There are many hormones that are associated with satiety, and various organs secrete these hormones, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an example of one of these satiety hormones and is secreted in response to nutrients in the gut, especially fat and protein. In addition to inhibiting food intake, CCK stimulates pancreatic secretions, gall bladder contractions, and intestinal motility—all of which aide in the digestion of nutrients.3\\nAdipose tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Adipose is the primary organ that produces the hormone leptin, and as fat stores increase, more leptin is produced. Higher levels of leptin communicate to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. Leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked excitement in the research world and the weight loss industry, as it was hypothesized that leptin might be used as a weight loss drug to decrease food intake. In several clinical trials, it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it. Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person, there is generally no sustained effect on food intake.4\\nFigure 7.7. The structure of the hormone leptin (left), which is primarily produced by adipose tissue. The obese mouse in the photo has a gene mutation that makes it unable to produce leptin, resulting in constant hunger, lethargy, and severe obesity. For comparison, a mouse with normal leptin production is also shown. Such gene mutations are rare, but they serve as a dramatic illustration of the importance of the hormone in signaling energy balance.'}],\n",

It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn’t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride’s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\\nFluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\\n* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\\n* Preventing demineralization of teeth\\n* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\\nAs a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\\nFluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water.'}],\n",
       "  'rag_response': \"Fluoride is a well-known agent in preventing tooth decay, and its mechanisms of action are crucial in understanding its effectiveness. According to the available information, fluoride combats tooth decay through three primary mechanisms: blocking acid formation by bacteria, preventing demineralization of teeth, and enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel [ns_382].\\n\\nFirstly, fluoride inhibits the formation of acid by bacteria, which is a key step in the development of tooth decay. By blocking this process, fluoride reduces the likelihood of acid erosion and subsequent tooth decay. This mechanism is particularly important, as it targets the root cause of tooth decay and prevents the progression of the disease.\\n\\nSecondly, fluoride prevents demineralization of teeth by making them more resistant to acid attacks. This is achieved by increasing the tooth's ability to remineralize, or rebuild, its enamel structure. By strengthening the tooth's enamel, fluoride creates a barrier against acid erosion, making it more difficult for bacteria to penetrate and cause decay.\\n\\nLastly, fluoride enhances remineralization of destroyed enamel, which is a critical step in reversing tooth decay. By promoting the remineralization process, fluoride helps to repair and restore damaged enamel, reducing the risk of further decay and promoting overall oral health.\\n\\nIn summary, fluoride's three mechanisms of action – blocking acid formation, preventing demineralization, and enhancing remineralization – make it an effective agent in combating tooth decay and promoting oral health.\",\n",

It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\\nIt is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body’s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\\nIn addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g/kg/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g/kg/day for muscle synthesis.3\\nAlthough athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements.

People are in nitrogen balance when they excrete as much nitrogen as they consume.\\n* Negative Nitrogen Balance– A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who is eating a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than they actually need.\\nFigure 6.15. People are in negative nitrogen balance when they excrete more nitrogen than they consume, usually because they are not eating enough protein to meet their needs.\\n* Positive Nitrogen Balance– A person is in positive nitrogen balance when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during pregnancy or growth in childhood. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.\\nFigure 6.16.

Different types of food that are high in saturated fats are likely to have different effects on health.

The remaining 1% of the body’s calcium is found in the blood and soft tissues, but it is here that calcium performs its most critical functions. For example, calcium is required for the transmission of every nerve impulse, electrical signals sent from one nerve cell to another. It’s also required for every cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. With inadequate calcium, muscles can’t relax, and instead become stiff and contract involuntarily, a condition known as tetany. Calcium also plays vital roles in blood pressure regulation, blood clotting, enzyme activation, hormone secretion, and signaling between cells.1\\nThe many roles of calcium around the body are critical to daily survival, so maintaining homeostasis, or a steady state, of blood calcium levels is a high priority. The body rigorously controls blood calcium levels in a very tight range. If blood calcium drops, your body initiates several mechanisms to restore homeostasis, including drawing calcium from the bone. While the calcium stored in bone is important for long-term strength and structure of bone, it also serves as a calcium reserve that can be drawn upon to support the vital functions of calcium in the body, should blood calcium drop too low.\\nTwo endocrine glands are key players in the regulation of blood calcium concentrations: the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It secretes a hormone called calcitonin. There are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea and located at the back of the thyroid gland. They secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).\\nFigure 9.4. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located at the back of the neck.\\nLet’s take a closer look at how the body regulates blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium concentration drops too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH then acts in several ways to increase blood calcium levels:\\n1. PTH stimulates the activity of osteoclasts to release calcium from bone.\\n2. PTH acts on the kidney to reduce the amount of calcium lost in the urine, returning more to circulation.\\n3. PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that convert vitamin D to its active form, also called calcitriol. Activated vitamin D acts on the intestine to increase the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D also works together with PTH to stimulate release of calcium from the bone and reduce calcium loss in urine.\\nOnce blood calcium levels are normal, PTH levels drop, turning off all of these mechanisms of increasing calcium.\\nOn the other hand, if blood calcium levels become too high, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits the release of calcium from the bone and increases calcium excretion from the kidneys. These mechanisms help to restore normal blood calcium concentrations, after which calcitonin levels drop again.\\nFigure 9.5. Blood calcium (Ca2+) levels are tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin.\\nThrough these two opposing pathways—PTH and vitamin D for raising blood calcium and calcitonin for lowering blood calcium—the body can very effectively maintain blood calcium homeostasis. This system is dependent upon stored calcium in bone, which is sacrificed when needed to ensure adequate blood calcium. In the short-term, this isn’t a problem, because bone remodeling allows you to replace calcium in the bone. However, in the long-term, inadequate dietary calcium means you continuously draw down the calcium stores in your bones, resulting in declining bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture.\\nCalcium requirements are highest for children and adolescents, who are growing and building bones, and for older adults, who are losing bone density.'}],\n",

Intestinal cells form the barrier between the interior of the body and the lumen, or tube, of the GI tract, which is technically outside of the body and teeming with potential pathogens. Immune tissue in the GI tract and other parts of the body produce immune cells that target foreign invaders, in part through the production of antibodies, protective proteins that bind to foreign substances. However, this function requires the immune system to accurately distinguish between normal food proteins and invading pathogens. A food allergy\\xa0is what happens if the immune system mistakenly identifies a food protein as an invasive threat.\\nThe most common type of food allergy involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to a specific substance, orallergen. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur immediately after consuming the food (i.e., within seconds to minutes), although reactions can sometimes be delayed by two hours or more. Because an allergic reaction is caused by the immune system, it can lead to symptoms all over the body, including skin rashes; swollen lips, face, or throat; wheezing and difficulty breathing; nausea and vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; and rarely, a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction involving more than one organ system—a rash coupled with difficulty breathing, for example—is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately with epinephrine, commonly administered by injection with a device such as an EpiPen, and then person should seek immediate medical attention.1\\nFigure 3.19. Common food allergens: peanuts, dairy, wheat, eggs, and shrimp. At right, an EpiPen, containing injectable epinephrine, is pictured. \\nThe most common food allergies in the U.S. are caused by proteins in peanuts, tree nuts, milk, shellfish, eggs, fish, wheat, soy and sesame.4,5 A 2019 study reported that 19% of adults in the U.S. believe they’re allergic to at least one food. After asking people about their symptoms, the researchers estimated that the true incidence of food allergies is closer to 11%, while the remaining 8% of people likely have a food intolerance.4\\nFood allergies are common in children, affecting about 8% of U.S. children, although allergies can also develop later in life.5 It’s common for young children to outgrow allergies to egg, dairy, wheat, or soy, but peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are often lifelong. Recent research has found that letting babies eat common food allergens, particularly peanut products, can prevent the development of allergies, perhaps by allowing the immune system an early opportunity to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens.6\\nIf you think you may have a food allergy, it’s important to see an allergist to ensure you have an accurate diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed based on symptoms after consuming a food, specific IgE blood tests, and/or skin prick tests, where a tiny amount of food protein is scratched onto the skin to test for a reaction. Blood and skin tests determine whether a person is sensitized to an allergen, meaning that they’re producing IgE antibodies to the food. However, the presence of IgE antibodies doesn’t definitively mean a person has a food allergy; it’s common to have a positive IgE test but still be able to eat the food without symptoms. The gold standard test for diagnosing is an oral food challenge—consuming a small amount of the food and watching for signs of a reaction—although due to time, cost, and risk, these are not always conducted. If you are diagnosed with a food allergy, you will be counseled to strictly avoid the food and carry injectable epinephrine in case of accidental consumption.'}]}]"

Both types of fatty acids are associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels and a lower risk of heart disease [ns_136].\\n\\nPUFAs, in particular, have been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and CVD-related deaths due to their ability to lower blood levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol [ns_164]. MUFAs, found in plant sources like olive oil and nuts, may also be associated with a reduced risk of CVD [ns_164]. However, it's essential to note that replacing saturated fats with refined carbohydrates may increase the risk of heart disease, highlighting the importance of choosing healthy fats and whole foods.\\n\\nIn summary, the primary difference between MUFAs and PUFAs is the number of double bonds in their carbon chain, with MUFAs having one double bond and PUFAs having two or more. Both types of fatty acids have distinct food sources and are associated with various health benefits, including lower LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.\",\n",
      "    \"Emulsification is a crucial process in lipid digestion that involves breaking down large fat globules into smaller droplets, making lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes. This process is facilitated by bile salts, which have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic sides, allowing them to interact with both the fat globules and the watery environment of the digestive tract [ns_146]. As a result, emulsification increases the surface area for enzymes to act, enabling pancreatic lipases to enzymatically digest triglycerides into fatty acids, monoglycerides, and free glycerol.\\n\\nMoreover, emulsification plays a vital role in facilitating the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form micelles, allowing fats to get close to intestinal cells for absorption [ns_147]. This process enables the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream, which are then transported to cells around the body.\\n\\nIn addition, emulsification is essential for the digestion of lipids in the watery environment of the digestive tract. By breaking down large droplets of triglycerides into smaller droplets, emulsification allows for enzymatic digestion using lipases [ns_143]. This ultimately facilitates the absorption of lipids into circulation and their transportation around the body.\\n\\nIn conclusion, emulsification is a critical process in lipid digestion that enables the breakdown of large fat globules into smaller droplets, making lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes. It also facilitates the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream and the digestion of lipids in the watery environment of the digestive tract.\",\n",
      "    \"The regulation of blood calcium levels is a crucial process in the human body, and it is achieved through the coordinated effort of two hormones: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Calcitonin. These hormones play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of calcium levels in the blood, and their production is regulated by the endocrine system.\\n\\nPTH is produced by the Parathyroid glands [ns_369], which are located in the neck. This hormone plays a crucial role in increasing calcium levels in the blood by stimulating the release of calcium from bones and increasing calcium absorption in the intestines.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Calcitonin is produced by the Thyroid gland [ns_369]. This hormone has the opposite effect of PTH, as it helps to decrease calcium levels in the blood by reducing calcium absorption in the intestines and increasing calcium excretion in the urine.\\n\\nIn summary, the two hormones involved in blood calcium regulation are PTH and Calcitonin, with PTH being produced by the Parathyroid glands and Calcitonin being produced by the Thyroid gland.\",\n",
      "    \"Introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies during their first year of life is crucial for several reasons. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends introducing iron-rich foods first, followed by other foods, including potentially allergenic ones, one at a time to monitor for allergic reactions [ns_477]. This approach allows parents to identify any potential allergic reactions early on and take necessary precautions.\\n\\nMoreover, introducing potentially allergenic foods during this period can significantly reduce the risk of developing food allergies. For instance, introducing peanut products between 4-11 months has been shown to reduce peanut allergy by 81% [ns_478]. Similarly, early introduction of egg can protect children from developing an egg allergy. This is because the immune system is still developing and is more likely to learn to tolerate common allergens if exposed to them early on, reducing the risk of lifelong allergies [ns_38].\\n\\nBy introducing these foods early on, parents can help their babies' immune system learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens, making it less likely for allergies to develop. This approach can provide long-term benefits, as it can help prevent the development of lifelong allergies. Overall, introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies during their first year of life is an important step in promoting a healthy and robust immune system.\"\n",
