      "summarized_document": "Photosynthesis is essential for the food we eat as it provides energy for plants, which are consumed by animals and humans. The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain, ultimately ending up in the food we eat. This includes meat, dairy, bread, cereals, pastas, desserts, drinks, and spices, as all of these products are linked back to photosynthesis through the plants that produce them."

      "summarized_document": "Photosynthesis produces glucose, a simple carbohydrate molecule, which is used by plants as an energy source. This glucose is stored in plants as starch, which can be broken down into glucose when needed. Humans consume foods that contain starch, such as seeds, roots, and tubers, and digest them into single sugars (glucose) to absorb and use as an energy source."

      "summarized_document": "Photosynthesis contributes to the food we eat by producing organic compounds that are consumed by heterotrophic organisms, which are at the base of almost every food chain. Without photosynthetic organisms, mass starvation would result, making them essential for life on Earth."
