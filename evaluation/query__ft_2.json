      "full_document": "Photosynthesis\u00a0is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and convert it into a chemical compound (glucose) that every organism uses to power its daily functions. Photosynthesis is also a source of oxygen necessary for many living organisms.\nThe importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight\u2019s energy. Photosynthesis is vital because it provides a way to capture the energy from solar radiation (the \u201cphoto-\u201d part) and store that energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of glucose (the \u201c-synthesis\u201d part). Glucose is the main energy source that animals and humans use to power the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the energy-containing molecule found in the cells of all animals and humans. Energy from the foods we eat is captured in ATP and used to fuel the workload of cells.1\nThe energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. Consider a predator, such as a wolf, preying on a deer. The wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from atoms colliding on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to the deer, and finally to the wolf. The\u00a0wolf, by feeding on the deer, receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed.\nOur food supply is also directly linked to photosynthesis. Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume. Although there is a large variety, each item ultimately can be linked back to photosynthesis. Meat and dairy link because the animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar\u2014sucrose is a plant product, a carbohydrate molecule, which is also derived from photosynthesis. Many items are less obviously derived from plants: virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. (Salt is a notable exception.) Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.",
      "summarized_document": "Photosynthesis is essential for the food we eat as it provides energy stored in glucose, which is the main energy source for animals and humans. This energy is passed through the food chain and ultimately ends up in the food we consume, including meat, dairy, bread, cereals, pastas, desserts, and drinks, as many of these products contain plant-based ingredients or are derived from photosynthesis-dependent plants."

      "full_document": "Photosynthesis generally takes place in the leaves of plants. It is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2, found in the air), and water (H2O, from the soil). After the process is complete, the plant releases oxygen into the air (O2, essential for many living organisms) and produces the simple carbohydrate molecule of glucose, which can be used as an energy source by the plant, converted to starch and stored for a later energy source, or converted into other organic molecules such as fats, proteins and vitamins. This glucose contains the energy that all living organisms need to survive.\nFigure 3.5. Depiction of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant.\nThe basic formula for photosynthesis is as follows:\n6CO2 + 6H2O + sun\u2019s energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2\nAnother way of saying this:\n| Photosynthesis uses: | 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (6CO2) 6 molecules of water (6H2O) the sun\u2019s energy |\n| --- | --- |\n| Photosynthesis produces: | 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) 6 molecules of oxygen (6O2) |\n|  |  |\nStarch is the storage form of glucose in plants, stored in seeds, roots, and tubers for later use as an energy source for the plant to reproduce. When a seed is buried deep in the soil, this starch can be broken down into glucose to be used for energy for the seed to sprout. As the seed sprouts, and shoots go above the ground and leaves start to form, the new plant can then photosynthesize glucose for an energy source. When we eat foods that contain starch, we must digest that starch down into single sugars (glucose) in order for the glucose to be absorbed into the intestinal cells, where it will enter the bloodstream to be carried to all cells of the body to use as an energy source. The basic process of digestion of these foods will be covered in the next section.",

      "full_document": "Life is extraordinarily complex. That\u2019s true whether you\u2019re considering something as seemingly simple as a blade of grass or as obviously complicated as the human body. However, zooming in to look at the most basic elements of living things\u2014from atoms to molecules to cells\u2014we can start to see similarities and patterns that help us make sense of this complexity. And as we consider biological processes, such as photosynthesis, digestion, and metabolism, we also see how these processes fit together. Plants use photosynthesis to capture energy from the sun. Animals, humans included, eat the plants (or other animals that ate the plants) and use the processes of digestion and metabolism to utilize the energy they contain. In the process of energy metabolism, animals breathe out carbon dioxide, which is then used by plants for photosynthesis. It\u2019s truly a circle of life!\nIn this unit, we\u2019ll also zero in on the digestive system. While all organ systems relate to nutrition in some way, the digestive system takes center stage as the site of food processing and nutrient extraction. And while it usually functions as an efficient and coordinated system, we\u2019ll also consider some common ways that it can go awry, resulting in disorders and discomforts of the digestive tract or adverse reactions to certain foods.",

      "full_document": "As we just learned in the previous section, cells are the most basic building blocks of life. Cells make up your tissues, organs, and ultimately, you as a human being. And every one of those cells needs energy to perform their specific functions. Where does that energy come from? It comes from the macronutrients that we eat\u2014carbohydrates, protein, and fat. In order to understand how the cells of the body put that energy to use, you must have a basic understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and the relationship between these two processes.",

      "full_document": "If you compare the summary reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration, you can see that cellular respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. Because each process starts where the other ends, they form a cycle. What one reaction uses, the other reaction produces, and what one produces the other uses.\nFigure 3.7. The relationship between the reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.\nThe cycling that occurs between photosynthesis and cellular respiration is vital to the health of planet Earth. If there was no way for the carbon dioxide produced through cellular respiration to be utilized, breathing organisms (like humans and animals) would soon suffocate. Additionally, photosynthetic organisms are at the base of almost every food chain on the planet, so without these organisms, mass starvation would result. Luckily, this planet is full of organisms capable of photosynthesis (e.g., trees and grass on land and algae and bacteria in the ocean). Without this vital connection between photosynthesis and cellular respiration, life as we know it would cease to exist.\nFigure 3.8. The photosynthesis-cellular respiration cycle. The two processes are intimately linked.",

      "full_document": "Here\u2019s the chemical structure of glucose:\nIn this class, we\u2019ll sometimes use a simpler green hexagon to represent glucose: \nYou\u2019re already familiar with glucose, because it\u2019s the main product of photosynthesis. Plants make glucose as a way of storing the sun\u2019s energy in a form that it can use for growth and reproduction.\nIn humans, glucose is one of the most important nutrients for fueling the body. It\u2019s especially important for the brain and nervous system, which aren\u2019t very good at using other fuel sources. Muscles, on the other hand, can use fat as an energy source. (In practice, your muscles are usually using some combination of fat and glucose for energy, which we\u2019ll learn more about later.)\nFood sources of glucose: Glucose is found in fruits and vegetables, as well as honey, corn syrup, and high fructose corn syrup. (All plants make glucose, but much of the glucose is used to make starch, fiber, and other nutrients. The foods listed here have glucose in its monosaccharide form.)",
