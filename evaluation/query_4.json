            "document": "Because our bodies are so efficient at recycling amino acids, protein needs are not as high as carbohydrate and fat needs. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for a sedentary adult is 0.8 g per kg body weight per day. This would mean that a 165-pound man and a 143-pound woman would need 60 g and 52 g of protein per day, respectively. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is 10% to 35% of total energy intake. A Tolerable Upper Intake Limit for protein has not been set, but it is recommended that you not exceed the upper end of the AMDR.\nProtein needs are higher for the following populations:\n* growing children and adolescents\n* women who are pregnant (they\u2019re using protein to help grow a fetus)\n* lactating women (breast milk has protein in it for the baby\u2019s nutrition, so mothers need more protein to synthesize that milk)\n* athletes\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day for athletes, depending on the type of training.1 Higher intakes may be needed for short periods during intensified training or with reduced energy intake."

            "document": "Although protein accounts for only about 5% of energy expended, dietary protein is necessary to support metabolic reactions that generate ATP, which rely heavily on proteins such as enzymes and transport proteins. Additional protein also helps muscles with maintenance, growth, and repair. For these reasons, athletes have higher protein needs than the general population. It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\nIt is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body\u2019s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\nIn addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g/kg/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g/kg/day for muscle synthesis.3\nAlthough athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements. Here are some examples of snacks or small meals that contain at least 15 to 25 grams of protein4:\n* \u00bd cup of granola plus \u00bc cup almonds (16 grams protein)\n* 7 oz. Greek yogurt (20 grams protein)\n* Peanut butter sandwich (20 grams protein)\n* 2 scrambled eggs and 1 cup of milk (20 grams protein)\n* 3 oz. canned tuna (\u00bd can) with \u00bd cup crackers (22 grams protein)\n* Turkey and cheese sandwich (32 grams protein)\nThese whole food options have the benefit of coming packaged with other nutrients, including carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, fiber, and micronutrients, and are often less costly than most protein supplements. Like all dietary supplements, protein shakes and other supplements are not well-regulated; some contain unnecessary additives such as sweeteners and herbs, and some have been found to contain unsafe levels of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury. Protein supplements do have the benefit of being convenient and shelf-stable. If you choose to use a protein supplement, look for one certified by a third-party testing organization and with a simple ingredient list.5"

            "document": "A healthy diet incorporates all nutrients in moderation, meaning that there\u2019s neither too little nor too much. As with all nutrients, having too little or too much protein can have health consequences.\nThe AMDR for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent of kilocalories.1 That\u2019s a fairly wide range, and it encompasses typical protein intakes of many traditional human cultures.\nFig. 6.22. Diverse human cultures have survived on different levels of dietary protein. The photo on the left shows Inuit families sharing frozen, aged walrus meat. Their traditional diet is very dependent on meat and high in both protein and fat. On the right is a traditional vegetarian meal in India, high in carbohydrates but still providing adequate levels of protein. \nProtein intake below the RDA is inadequate to support the body\u2019s needs for synthesis of structural and functional proteins. On the other hand, there are some concerns that high protein intake is associated with chronic disease. However, as we\u2019ll discuss, it\u2019s not just the quantity of protein that matters, but also the nutritional package that it comes in.\nAccording to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, most Americans get enough protein, averaging about 88 grams per day and 14 to 16 percent of caloric intake. The study also found that diets with protein above 35 percent of caloric intake, the upper end of the AMDR, were extremely rare.2"

            "document": "When the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine wrote the DRI for macronutrients, published in 2005, they concluded that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to establish an Upper Limit for protein. The high end of the AMDR, 35 percent of kilocalories for protein, was set in order to allow the total diet to be well-balanced with carbohydrate and fat.1 Higher levels of protein intake haven\u2019t been well-studied, but over the years, there have been many concerns with high protein diets. However, current evidence indicates it\u2019s large amounts of animal protein (particularly from red meat or processed meats) that can be problematic, not high amounts of protein per se.5\nFor example, a diet containing lots of steak, bacon, and sausage would be high in protein, but it also might be high in saturated fat, cholesterol, salt, and nitrates. Eating more red meat and processed red meat is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer (especially colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and breast cancers). This link doesn\u2019t seem to be caused by the protein but rather the nutritional package that it comes in. In addition, the link to cancer may be related to the carcinogens that can form when meat is cooked at high temperatures, particularly when it\u2019s charred by grilling.5\nOn the other hand, studies show that when protein comes from lean meat and plant sources, risk of chronic diseases may be reduced. For example, a 2015 study found that frequent consumption of red meat in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer later in life, whereas consuming poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts instead lowered risk.6 Other studies have shown that higher protein diets can reduce the risk of heart disease, provided the protein comes from healthier sources.\nFig. 6.24. Compare several different \u201cprotein packages.\u201d The steak and bacon provide protein but also large amounts of saturated fat and sodium. Salmon provides as much protein as the steak but with less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fats. Lentils are a good source of protein, are low in fat, and are a great source of fiber. \nSeveral other concerns about high protein diets haven\u2019t turned out to be problematic after all:\n* Osteoporosis \u2013 High protein diets were once thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis, because researchers noticed that urinary calcium excretion increases when people consume high amounts of protein. However, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation found that this is not a concern, and some studies even show that higher protein intake is associated with greater bone mineral density.7\n* Kidney function \u2013 Another concern was that high protein diets would strain the kidneys because of the increased need to filter and excrete nitrogen. A 2018 meta-analysis concluded that this is not a concern. However, people who already have chronic kidney disease should avoid high protein diets and maintain protein intake around the RDA of 0.8 g/kg, a lower intake than many Americans are consuming.8 A 2009 study tested a very low protein diet of 0.6 g/kg protein per day in people with chronic kidney disease and found that it did not prevent the development of kidney failure but did increase the risk of death, underscoring the importance of adequate protein even in people with kidney disease.9\nFrom all of this research, there\u2019s little evidence that a high protein diet is inherently harmful, so long as the protein doesn\u2019t come packaged with a lot of saturated fat and red meat consumption is limited. Still, there\u2019s little research directly testing the health effects of very high protein diets, including those achieved using protein supplements of purified protein, so it\u2019s probably wise to keep protein balanced with the other macronutrients, focusing on whole foods from all the food groups."

            "document": "The appropriate amount of protein in a person\u2019s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When amino acids are broken down, nitrogen is released. Most nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, but some urea is also contained in feces. Nitrogen is also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to balance the amount of protein used by the body, measured as the amount of nitrogen lost from the body. The Institute Of Medicine used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein.\n* Nitrogen Balance\u2013 A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen consumed equals the amount of nitrogen excreted. Most healthy adults are in nitrogen balance. If more protein is consumed than needed, this extra protein is used for energy, and the nitrogen waste that results is excreted. The lowest amount of protein a person can consume and still remain in nitrogen balance represents that person\u2019s minimum protein requirement.\nFigure 6.14. People are in nitrogen balance when they excrete as much nitrogen as they consume.\n* Negative Nitrogen Balance\u2013 A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who is eating a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than they actually need.\nFigure 6.15. People are in negative nitrogen balance when they excrete more nitrogen than they consume, usually because they are not eating enough protein to meet their needs.\n* Positive Nitrogen Balance\u2013 A person is in positive nitrogen balance when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during pregnancy or growth in childhood. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.\nFigure 6.16. People are in positive nitrogen balance when they excrete less nitrogen than they consume, because they are using protein to actively build new tissue."
