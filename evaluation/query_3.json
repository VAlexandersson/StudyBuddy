            "document": "Fluoride is a trace mineral needed in very small amounts in the body. It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn\u2019t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride\u2019s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\nFluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\n* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\n* Preventing demineralization of teeth\n* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\nAs a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\nFluoride\u2019s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water."

            "document": "Research shows that adopting an eating pattern that is relatively low in added sugars has many benefits, including a lower risk of:\n* Cardiovascular disease\n* Obesity\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Some cancers\n* Dental cavities\nWhy does too much added sugar cause health problems? The reasons are complex, and this is an ongoing area of research and controversy. One possible explanation is that a diet high in added sugar means the pancreas has to work hard to make enough insulin, and over time, it can begin to fail and the body\u2019s cells start to become insulin resistant. The liver also has to work hard to metabolize fructose, and too much fructose increases fat synthesis, which can raise blood lipid and cholesterol levels, increasing risk of heart disease.\nBoth dietary sucrose and starch are associated with tooth decay. Bacteria living in the mouth can utilize the carbohydrates passing through the oral cavity for their own benefit. Those bacteria happily metabolize carbohydrates, especially sucrose, but also starchy foods, which stick to teeth and linger there. Acid is formed in the process, and this can dissolve your tooth enamel, eventually causing cavities, also known as dental caries. Reducing sugar intake, limiting between-meal snacks, and brushing after meals to remove lingering carbohydrates can help reduce the risk of dental caries. The use of fluoride and regular dental care also help.\nFig. 4.36. Dental caries are formed because of a combination of factors: the presence of oral bacteria; a supply of sugar and/or starch for them to eat; tooth surface where they can form colonies, or plaque; and time."

            "document": "Since it is a nonessential mineral, there is no defined fluoride requirement, but lower levels are associated with higher rates of dental cavities in adults and children. This connection is why so many water supplies are fluoridated.\nHowever, as with all minerals, fluoride can also be quite toxic if consumed in excessive amounts. Acute toxicity symptoms from large intakes of fluoride include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity results in an irreversible condition known as fluorosis, characterized by the mottling (i.e., white speckling) and pitting of the teeth (see Figure 9.10). Fluorosis is primarily a risk in children, because mineralization of permanent teeth has typically occurred by age 8.6\nFigure 9.10. A mild case of fluorosis (left) vs. a severe case of fluorosis (right).\nBecause fluoridated oral care products often taste good, making them appealing to young children, it is important to make sure infants and children do not consume too much fluoride by swallowing toothpaste or other oral care products. Recommendations for managing fluoride intake in children include the following:7-9\n* Do not use any fluoride supplement without talking to your health care provider.\n* Consider a prescription fluoride supplement for children who live in communities without fluoridated water or rely on a well water supply that is not fluoridated.\n* Use only a smear (rice-sized) amount of fluoride toothpaste as soon as the first tooth erupts in infants up through age 2 years.\n* Use only a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste in children ages 3 to 6 years.\n* Encourage children to spit out toothpaste instead of swallowing it.\n* Avoid fluoride mouth rinses in children younger than 6 years."
