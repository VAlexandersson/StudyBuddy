      "summarized_document": "Bile salts, with their hydrophobic and hydrophilic sides, act as emulsifiers, breaking down large fat globules into smaller droplets, making lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes. This increases the surface area for enzymes to act, facilitating the absorption of lipids in the small intestine."

      "summarized_document": "Bile salts, an emulsifier, break down large fat droplets into smaller ones, allowing them to mix with watery digestive juices, facilitating emulsification and absorption of lipids in the small intestine. The bile salts also help to increase the surface area of the small intestine, allowing for more efficient absorption of nutrients."

      "summarized_document": "Bile salts emulsify lipids in the small intestine by breaking down large triglyceride droplets into smaller ones, allowing lipases to enzymatically digest lipid molecules. The emulsified lipids are then absorbed into circulation, with bile salts also facilitating this process by solubilizing and transporting the digested lipids."
