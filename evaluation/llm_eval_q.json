            "depth_explanation": "The response provides good elaboration on the mechanism of emulsification and its importance. However, by including details about micelle formation and absorption, it shifts the focus slightly away from the core process of emulsification.",
            "information_usage_score": 7,
            "information_usage_explanation": "The response effectively uses the primary passage (ns_146) to explain emulsification. However, it also incorporates information from other passages (ns_147, ns_143) that are related but not directly focused on the emulsification process itself.",

            "appropriateness_explanation": "The response is mostly suitable for undergraduate students, providing a clear explanation of emulsification.

            "overall_assessment": "The RAG system provides a good explanation of emulsification and its importance in lipid digestion. However, it would be more effective if it focused solely on the emulsification process itself without delving into the subsequent steps of micelle formation and absorption. While the included information is accurate and related, it makes the response less focused and potentially more complex than necessary for an undergraduate student seeking a clear understanding of emulsification.",
            "improvement_suggestions": "The response could be improved by focusing solely on the process of emulsification and its importance for lipid digestion. Removing the information about micelle formation and absorption would create a more concise and focused response that directly addresses the query. This information could be provided in separate responses based on specific queries about those processes."
