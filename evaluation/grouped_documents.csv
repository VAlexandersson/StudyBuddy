explain how a deficiency in vitamin d can negatively affect bone health,"[ns_389] Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.
In dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.
Vitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations—chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person’s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.
Recall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we’ll discuss later on this page.
Figure 9.11. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin (vitamin D3) or provided in the diet (vitamin D2 or D3). It is converted by reactions occurring first in the liver (making calcidiol) and then kidney (making calcitriol, the active form). Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.
Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1","[ns_392] In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, a disease in which the bones are soft, weak, and deformed. Rickets was very common in the U.S. until the 1930s, when milk processors were asked to add vitamin D to cow’s milk. Milk fortification has virtually eliminated rickets from the U.S. and other developed countries. However, rickets does still occur in breastfed infants and children raised on vegan diets who aren’t provided with other sources of vitamin D, particularly if they have darker skin pigmentation.1,3
Figure 9.13. Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, a disease in which inadequate vitamin D leads to soft, weak, and deformed bones.
In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia, characterized by softening of bones, reduced bone mineral density, and increased risk of osteoporosis. Because bones are continuously remodelled throughout the lifespan, inadequate vitamin D limits the calcium available to continue to rebuild bone tissue. Vitamin D deficiency can also cause bone pain, as well as muscle weakness and pain, symptoms that can increase the risk of falling and fractures, particularly in older adults.2
Although vitamin D toxicity is rare, taking excessive amounts of vitamin D in supplement form can lead to hypercalcemia, or high blood calcium. Hypercalcemia can cause kidney damage and calcium deposits to develop in soft tissues such as the kidneys, blood vessels, or other parts of the cardiovascular system. Synthesis of vitamin D from the sun does not cause vitamin D toxicity, because vitamin D synthesis is tightly regulated and decreases if the body has abundant vitamin D.","[ns_364] The best activities for stimulating new bone are weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, hiking, and dancing, and resistance exercises like weight lifting.
* Nutrition- Ensuring adequate nutrition is a key component in maintaining bone health. Having low dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D are strong risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Protein is also important during childhood and adolescence for proper bone development, and in older age to preserve bone mass.4
* Smoking- Smoking cigarettes has long been known to correlate to a decrease in bone mass and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, because people who smoke are more likely to be physically inactive and have poor diets, it is difficult to determine whether smoking itself causes osteoporosis. Smoking is also linked to earlier menopause, and therefore the increased risk of developing osteoporosis among female smokers may also be attributed, at least in part, to having reduced estrogen production at an earlier age. However, studies have also shown that tobacco smoke and nicotine can directly impact bone metabolism.5
* Alcohol intake- Alcohol intake may also affect bone health, although this seems to depend on the amount consumed. Light to moderate alcohol intake (two drinks or less per day) has been shown in some studies to be associated with an increase in bone density and a decreased risk of developing osteoporosis. However, excessive alcohol intake is associated with decreased bone density and increased fracture risk, although this may be due in part to other lifestyle factors, such as poor diet and less physical activity.6
* Being underweight- Being underweight significantly increases the risk of developing osteoporosis, because people who are underweight often have a smaller frame size and a lower peak bone mass. The most striking relationship between being underweight and bone health is seen in people with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is strongly correlated with low peak bone mass, and more than 50 percent of men and women who have this illness develop osteoporosis, often very early in life.
The changeable risk factors for osteoporosis provide ways for people to improve their bone health, even though some people may be genetically predisposed to the disease. Prevention of osteoporosis begins early in life since this is a critical time of bone growth. Eating a balanced diet that provides adequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and protein is important for bone health throughout the life cycle. Participating in exercise such as walking, hiking, and weight lifting, and refraining from risky behaviors like smoking and excessive drinking are all behaviors that will help protect bones..","[ns_363] Osteoporosis is a bone disease that occurs when bone density or bone mass decreases. The bone becomes thinner and more porous and is therefore more susceptible to breaking. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, more than 53 million people in the U.S. either have osteoporosis already or are at high risk of developing it due to low bone mass.1
Figure 9.2. Osteoporosis. This illustration shows the difference between the structure of normal bone, which is less porous, and bone with osteoporosis, which is more porous. The two circles located on the spine and hip represent the location of the images.
Bone loss usually occurs without symptoms, so osteoporosis is often called a silent disease. It can go undetected until bones become so weak that they fracture due to a sudden strain, bump, or fall.
One way bone health can be assessed is by measuring bone mineral density. A bone mineral density (BMD) test can detect osteoporosis and predict the risk of bone fracture. The most common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. This method can measure bone density over the entire body, but most often the DXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of overall bone strength and health. DXA is painless, non-invasive, uses low doses of radiation, and is the most accurate way to measure BMD.
An individual’s chances of developing osteoporosis depend on several risk factors, some of which are controllable and some of which are not. It is thought that genetic factors (such as sex and race) may account for up to 75 percent of bone mass, and lifestyle factors (such as diet and exercise habits) account for the remaining 25 percent.2
Osteoporosis risk factors that are biological and can’t be controlled:
* Body frame size- People with small frames are at higher risk for osteoporosis.
* Race- Caucasian and Asian populations are at higher risk of osteoporosis compared to African American and Hispanic populations, which are at lower risk.1
* Family history– Having a family member with osteoporosis may increase risk, as heredity seems to play a part in the development of osteoporosis.
* Age- After age 40, bone mass declines due to bone breakdown exceeding bone formation. Therefore, any person over the age of 40 has an increased likelihood of developing osteoporosis compared with a younger person. Starting out with a higher peak bone mass in early adulthood enables you to lose more bone during the aging process and not develop osteoporosis.
* Sex- Females, on average, have a lower peak bone mass compared with males (see Figure 9.3) and a much greater risk of developing osteoporosis, in part because of hormone levels.
* Hormones- The female hormone estrogen and the male hormone testosterone both help to increase peak bone mass. Estrogen is the primary female reproductive hormone, and it stimulates bone building and reduces bone breakdown. When women go through menopause (usually around age 50), they experience a natural decline in estrogen levels, which accelerates bone loss and increases the risk of developing osteoporosis (Figure 9.3).
Figure 9.3. Age and bone mass. Bone density peaks at about 30 years of age, and women lose bone mass more rapidly than men, particularly around menopause.
Risk factors that can be controlled:
* Physical inactivity- Physical inactivity lowers peak bone mass, decreases BMD at all ages, and is linked to an increase in fracture risk, especially in the elderly. Regular exercise can help individuals achieve greater peak bone mass, prevents bone loss for women and men age 30 and older, and maintains strength and balance to help prevent falls later in life.","[ns_390] In most people, vitamin D synthesis in the skin provides a significant portion of their body’s needs, and a little sun exposure can go a long way. Vitamin D researchers suggest that most people need between 5 and 30 minutes of sun exposure between 10 AM and 3 PM, at least twice per week, in order to synthesize adequate vitamin D. However, any factor that decreases exposure to UV rays can interfere with vitamin D synthesis, including the following:2
* Geographic latitude and season. Your location on Earth and the time of the year affects your exposure to UV radiation from the sun. Exposure to UV light is greatest at the equator and declines as you move further north or south. Likewise, in the summer months, the sun is directly overhead for a greater part of the day, so you have more opportunities to synthesize vitamin D. In the winter, the sun stays lower in the sky, day length is shorter, and cloud cover is more likely to block the sun’s rays, all of which decrease opportunities to synthesize vitamin D. North of about 35 degrees latitude, vitamin D synthesis is inadequate for at least a few months during the winter, because the sun simply doesn’t get high enough in the sky to provide enough UV radiation on earth’s surface. For example, in Boston and at the California-Oregon border (42nd parallel north), vitamin D synthesis occurs only from March until October. However, in Los Angeles (34th parallel north), vitamin D synthesis occurs year round. Ozone and air pollution can also block UV rays and decrease vitamin D synthesis.
* Skin pigmentation. Darker skin pigmentation, caused by greater melanin production in the skin, decreases UV light absorption. This helps to protect the skin from damage from UV radiation—a helpful adaptation for those living closer to the equator—but it also reduces synthesis of vitamin D. People with darker skin pigmentation need to spend more time in the sun in order to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D as lighter-skinned people.
* Age. The efficiency of vitamin D synthesis declines with age. In addition, older adults often spend less time outside so may receive less exposure to sunlight.
* Sun-protective behavior. While some UV light exposure is needed to synthesize vitamin D, UV radiation is also carcinogenic, and too much exposure increases the risk of skin cancer. It’s wise to protect your skin from UV radiation by applying sunscreen, covering up with clothing and a hat, finding shade, and avoiding sun exposure in the middle of the day. People who are highly vigilant in these sun-protective behaviors or simply aren’t able to go outside during the day (UV rays don’t penetrate glass) may not get enough UV light for vitamin D synthesis.
With so many factors affecting UV radiation exposure, many people are unable to synthesize enough vitamin D for at least part of the year. Because vitamin D is fat-soluble, liver and adipose storage can supply the body for a while. Beyond that, dietary sources and supplements may be needed to meet the vitamin D requirement.2","[ns_503] The recommended intake levels of several micronutrients are increased in older adulthood, while others are decreased. A few nutrient changes to note include the following:
* To slow bone loss, the recommendations for calcium increase from 1,000 milligrams per day to 1,200 milligrams per day for both men and women.
* Also to help protect bones, vitamin D recommendations increase from 600 IU to 800 IU per day for men and women.
* Vitamin B6 recommendations rise to 1.7 milligrams per day for older men and 1.5 milligrams per day for older women to help lower levels of homocysteine and protect against cardiovascular disease.
* Due to a decrease in the production of stomach acid, which can lead to an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine and decrease absorption of vitamin B12, older adults need an additional 2.4 micrograms per day of B12 compared to younger adults.
* For elderly women, higher iron levels are no longer needed post-menopause, and recommendations decrease from 18 milligrams per day to 8 milligrams per day."
how do bile salts contribute to both the emulsification and absorption of lipids in the small intestine,"[ns_147] Next, those products of fat digestion (fatty acids, monoglycerides, glycerol, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins) need to enter into the circulation so that they can be used by cells around the body. Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.
Figure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.
Once inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.
Chylomicrons are one type of lipoprotein—transport vehicles for lipids in blood and lymph. We’ll learn more about other types of lipoproteins on the next page.
Figure 5.23. Structure of a chylomicron. Cholesterol is not shown in this figure, but chylomicrons contain cholesterol in both the lipid core and embedded on the surface of the structure.
VIDEO: “Lipids—Digestion and Absorption,” by Alice Callahan, YouTube (November, 17, 2019), 8:49 minutes.","[ns_146] As the stomach contents enter the small intestine, most of the dietary lipids are undigested and clustered in large droplets. Bile, which is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts have both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, so they are attracted to both fats and water. This makes them effective emulsifiers, meaning that they break large fat globules into smaller droplets. Emulsification makes lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes by increasing the surface area for them to act (see Fig. 5.22 below).
The pancreas secretes pancreatic lipases into the small intestine to enzymatically digest triglycerides. Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids, monoglycerides (glycerol backbone with one fatty acid still attached), and some free glycerol. Cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins do not need to be enzymatically digested (see Fig. 5.22 below).
VIDEO: “Bile and Emulsification” by Fuse School – Global Education, YouTube (May 26, 2020), 3:35 minutes.","[ns_23] Chyme released from the stomach enters the small intestine, where most digestion and absorption occurs. The small intestine is divided into three parts, all part of one continuous tube: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.
Once the chyme enters the duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas and gallbladder are stimulated to release juices that aid in digestion. The pancreas (located behind the stomach) produces and secretes pancreatic juices which consist mostly of water, but also contain bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The small intestine’s absorptive cells also synthesize digestive enzymes that aid in the breakdown of sugars and proteins.
The gallbladder (a small sac located behind the liver) stores, concentrates, and secretes a fluid called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is an emulsifier; it acts similar to a detergent (that would remove grease from a frying pan) by breaking large fat droplets into smaller fat droplets so they can mix with the watery digestive juices.
Peristalsis and segmentation control the movement and mixing of chyme through the small intestine. As in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis consists of circular waves of smooth muscle contractions that propel food forward. Segmentation helps to mix food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.
Nutrient absorption takes place mainly in the latter part of the small intestine, the ileum. The small intestine is perfectly structured for maximizing nutrient absorption. Its surface area is greater than 200 square meters—about the size of a tennis court! The large surface area is due to the multiple levels of folding, villi, and microvilli that cover the internal tissue of the small intestine. Villi are tiny finger-like projections that are covered with enterocytes or absorptive cells. The absorptive cell membrane is made of even smaller projections, called microvilli (Figure 3.12). These microvilli are referred to collectively as the brush border since their appearance resembles the bristles on a brush.
Figure 3.12. Histology of the small intestine. (a) The absorptive surface of the small intestine is vastly enlarged by the presence of circular folds, villi, and microvilli. (b) Micrograph of the circular folds. (c) Micrograph of the villi. (d) Electron micrograph of the microvilli.
Digested nutrients are absorbed into either capillaries or lymphatic vessels contained within each villus. Amino acids (from protein digestion), small fatty acids (from triglyceride digestion), sugars (from carbohydrate digestion), water-soluble vitamins, and minerals are transported from the intestinal cells into the bloodstream through capillaries. The larger fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids (that are packaged in lipid transport particles) are transported first through lymphatic vessels and then eventually meet up with the blood. Water-soluble nutrients that enter the bloodstream are transported directly to the liver where the liver processes, stores, or releases these nutrients to other body cells.
Figure 3.13. The digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine.","[ns_143] Lipid digestion and absorption pose some special challenges. Triglycerides are large molecules, and unlike carbohydrates and proteins, they’re not water-soluble. Because of this, they like to cluster together in large droplets when they’re in a watery environment like the digestive tract. The digestive process has to break those large droplets of fat into smaller droplets and then enzymatically digest lipid molecules using enzymes called lipases. The mouth and stomach play a small role in this process, but most enzymatic digestion of lipids happens in the small intestine. From there, the products of lipid digestion are absorbed into circulation and transported around the body, which again requires some special handling since lipids are not water-soluble and do not mix with the watery blood.
Let’s start at the beginning to learn more about the path of lipids through the digestive tract.",,
how does the process of photosynthesis contribute to the food we eat,"[ns_9] Photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and convert it into a chemical compound (glucose) that every organism uses to power its daily functions. Photosynthesis is also a source of oxygen necessary for many living organisms.
The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight’s energy. Photosynthesis is vital because it provides a way to capture the energy from solar radiation (the “photo-” part) and store that energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of glucose (the “-synthesis” part). Glucose is the main energy source that animals and humans use to power the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the energy-containing molecule found in the cells of all animals and humans. Energy from the foods we eat is captured in ATP and used to fuel the workload of cells.1
The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. Consider a predator, such as a wolf, preying on a deer. The wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from atoms colliding on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to the deer, and finally to the wolf. The wolf, by feeding on the deer, receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed.
Our food supply is also directly linked to photosynthesis. Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume. Although there is a large variety, each item ultimately can be linked back to photosynthesis. Meat and dairy link because the animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar—sucrose is a plant product, a carbohydrate molecule, which is also derived from photosynthesis. Many items are less obviously derived from plants: virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. (Salt is a notable exception.) Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.","[ns_10] Photosynthesis generally takes place in the leaves of plants. It is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2, found in the air), and water (H2O, from the soil). After the process is complete, the plant releases oxygen into the air (O2, essential for many living organisms) and produces the simple carbohydrate molecule of glucose, which can be used as an energy source by the plant, converted to starch and stored for a later energy source, or converted into other organic molecules such as fats, proteins and vitamins. This glucose contains the energy that all living organisms need to survive.
Figure 3.5. Depiction of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant.
The basic formula for photosynthesis is as follows:
6CO2 + 6H2O + sun’s energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2
Another way of saying this:
| Photosynthesis uses: | 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (6CO2) 6 molecules of water (6H2O) the sun’s energy |
| --- | --- |
| Photosynthesis produces: | 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) 6 molecules of oxygen (6O2) |
|  |  |
Starch is the storage form of glucose in plants, stored in seeds, roots, and tubers for later use as an energy source for the plant to reproduce. When a seed is buried deep in the soil, this starch can be broken down into glucose to be used for energy for the seed to sprout. As the seed sprouts, and shoots go above the ground and leaves start to form, the new plant can then photosynthesize glucose for an energy source. When we eat foods that contain starch, we must digest that starch down into single sugars (glucose) in order for the glucose to be absorbed into the intestinal cells, where it will enter the bloodstream to be carried to all cells of the body to use as an energy source. The basic process of digestion of these foods will be covered in the next section.","[ns_0] Life is extraordinarily complex. That’s true whether you’re considering something as seemingly simple as a blade of grass or as obviously complicated as the human body. However, zooming in to look at the most basic elements of living things—from atoms to molecules to cells—we can start to see similarities and patterns that help us make sense of this complexity. And as we consider biological processes, such as photosynthesis, digestion, and metabolism, we also see how these processes fit together. Plants use photosynthesis to capture energy from the sun. Animals, humans included, eat the plants (or other animals that ate the plants) and use the processes of digestion and metabolism to utilize the energy they contain. In the process of energy metabolism, animals breathe out carbon dioxide, which is then used by plants for photosynthesis. It’s truly a circle of life!
In this unit, we’ll also zero in on the digestive system. While all organ systems relate to nutrition in some way, the digestive system takes center stage as the site of food processing and nutrient extraction. And while it usually functions as an efficient and coordinated system, we’ll also consider some common ways that it can go awry, resulting in disorders and discomforts of the digestive tract or adverse reactions to certain foods.","[ns_8] As we just learned in the previous section, cells are the most basic building blocks of life. Cells make up your tissues, organs, and ultimately, you as a human being. And every one of those cells needs energy to perform their specific functions. Where does that energy come from? It comes from the macronutrients that we eat—carbohydrates, protein, and fat. In order to understand how the cells of the body put that energy to use, you must have a basic understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and the relationship between these two processes.","[ns_12] If you compare the summary reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration, you can see that cellular respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. Because each process starts where the other ends, they form a cycle. What one reaction uses, the other reaction produces, and what one produces the other uses.
Figure 3.7. The relationship between the reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
The cycling that occurs between photosynthesis and cellular respiration is vital to the health of planet Earth. If there was no way for the carbon dioxide produced through cellular respiration to be utilized, breathing organisms (like humans and animals) would soon suffocate. Additionally, photosynthetic organisms are at the base of almost every food chain on the planet, so without these organisms, mass starvation would result. Luckily, this planet is full of organisms capable of photosynthesis (e.g., trees and grass on land and algae and bacteria in the ocean). Without this vital connection between photosynthesis and cellular respiration, life as we know it would cease to exist.
Figure 3.8. The photosynthesis-cellular respiration cycle. The two processes are intimately linked.","[ns_49] Here’s the chemical structure of glucose:
In this class, we’ll sometimes use a simpler green hexagon to represent glucose: 
You’re already familiar with glucose, because it’s the main product of photosynthesis. Plants make glucose as a way of storing the sun’s energy in a form that it can use for growth and reproduction.
In humans, glucose is one of the most important nutrients for fueling the body. It’s especially important for the brain and nervous system, which aren’t very good at using other fuel sources. Muscles, on the other hand, can use fat as an energy source. (In practice, your muscles are usually using some combination of fat and glucose for energy, which we’ll learn more about later.)
Food sources of glucose: Glucose is found in fruits and vegetables, as well as honey, corn syrup, and high fructose corn syrup. (All plants make glucose, but much of the glucose is used to make starch, fiber, and other nutrients. The foods listed here have glucose in its monosaccharide form.)"
