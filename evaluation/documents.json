        "document": "Next, those products of fat digestion (fatty acids, monoglycerides, glycerol, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins) need to enter into the circulation so that they can be used by cells around the body. Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.\nFigure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.\nOnce inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.\nChylomicrons are one type of lipoprotein\u2014transport vehicles for lipids in blood and lymph. We\u2019ll learn more about other types of lipoproteins on the next page.\nFigure 5.23. Structure of a chylomicron. Cholesterol is not shown in this figure, but chylomicrons contain cholesterol in both the lipid core and embedded on the surface of the structure.\nVIDEO: \u201cLipids\u2014Digestion and Absorption,\u201d by Alice Callahan, YouTube (November, 17, 2019), 8:49 minutes."

        "document": "As the stomach contents enter the small intestine, most of the dietary lipids are undigested and clustered in large droplets. Bile, which is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts have both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, so they are attracted to both fats and water. This makes them effective emulsifiers, meaning that they break large fat globules into smaller droplets. Emulsification makes lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes by increasing the surface area for them to act (see Fig. 5.22 below).\nThe pancreas secretes pancreatic lipases into the small intestine to enzymatically digest triglycerides. Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids, monoglycerides (glycerol backbone with one fatty acid still attached), and some free glycerol. Cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins do not need to be enzymatically digested (see Fig. 5.22 below).\nVIDEO: \u201cBile and Emulsification\u201d by Fuse School \u2013 Global Education, YouTube (May 26, 2020), 3:35 minutes."

        "document": "Chyme released from the stomach enters the small intestine, where most digestion and absorption occurs. The small intestine is divided into three parts, all part of one continuous tube: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.\nOnce the chyme enters the duodenum\u00a0(the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas and gallbladder are stimulated to release juices that aid in digestion. The pancreas\u00a0(located behind the stomach) produces and secretes pancreatic juices which consist mostly of water, but also contain bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The small intestine\u2019s absorptive cells also synthesize digestive enzymes that aid in the breakdown of sugars and proteins.\nThe gallbladder\u00a0(a small sac located behind the liver) stores, concentrates, and secretes a fluid called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile is made in the liver\u00a0and stored in the gallbladder. Bile\u00a0is an emulsifier; it acts similar to a detergent (that would remove grease from a frying pan) by breaking large fat droplets into smaller fat droplets so they can mix with the watery digestive juices.\nPeristalsis and segmentation control the movement and mixing of chyme through the small intestine. As in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis consists of circular waves of smooth muscle contractions that propel food forward. Segmentation helps to mix food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\nNutrient absorption takes place mainly in the latter part of the small intestine, the ileum.\u00a0The small intestine is perfectly structured for maximizing nutrient absorption. Its surface area is greater than 200 square meters\u2014about the size of a tennis court! The large surface area is due to the multiple levels of folding, villi, and microvilli that cover the internal tissue of the small intestine. Villi\u00a0are tiny finger-like projections that are covered with enterocytes\u00a0or absorptive cells. The absorptive cell membrane is made of even smaller projections, called microvilli\u00a0(Figure 3.12). These microvilli are referred to collectively as the brush border\u00a0since their appearance resembles the bristles on a brush.\nFigure 3.12. Histology of the small intestine. (a) The absorptive surface of the small intestine is vastly enlarged by the presence of circular folds, villi, and microvilli. (b) Micrograph of the circular folds. (c) Micrograph of the villi. (d) Electron micrograph of the microvilli.\nDigested nutrients are absorbed into either capillaries or lymphatic vessels contained within each villus. Amino acids (from protein digestion), small fatty acids (from triglyceride digestion), sugars (from carbohydrate digestion), water-soluble vitamins, and minerals are transported from the intestinal cells into the bloodstream through capillaries. The larger fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids (that are packaged in lipid transport particles) are transported first through lymphatic vessels and then eventually meet up with the blood. Water-soluble nutrients that enter the bloodstream are transported directly to the liver where the liver processes, stores, or releases these nutrients to other body cells.\nFigure 3.13. The digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine."

        "document": "Lipid digestion and absorption pose some special challenges. Triglycerides are large molecules, and unlike carbohydrates and proteins, they\u2019re not water-soluble. Because of this, they like to cluster together in large droplets when they\u2019re in a watery environment like the digestive tract. The digestive process has to break those large droplets of fat into smaller droplets and then enzymatically digest lipid molecules using enzymes called lipases. The mouth and stomach play a small role in this process, but most enzymatic digestion of lipids happens in the small intestine. From there, the products of lipid digestion are absorbed into circulation and transported around the body, which again requires some special handling since lipids are not water-soluble and do not mix with the watery blood.\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning to learn more about the path of lipids through the digestive tract."
