    "document":"[ns_18] The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\nThe first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication\u00a0(chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\nFood (now called a bolus\u00a0since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis\u00a0consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\nFigure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\nDigestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion\u00a0is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\nFigure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\nIn chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes\u00a0are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis\u00a0is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\nVideo: Enzyme Action and the Hydrolysis of Sucrose by McGraw-Hill Animations, YouTube (June 3, 2017). 1:46 minutes.\nNutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen\u00a0(or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\nIn excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.",

Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital contribution to this process.\nThe easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories: the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs.\n* The GI tract\u00a0is a one-way tube about 25 feet in length, beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. Between these two points, the GI tract also contains the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and the rectum. The small intestine is comprised of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The large intestine, also called the colon, is similarly divided into three sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. Both the mouth and anus are open to the external environment; thus, food and wastes within the GI tract are technically considered to be outside the body. Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body\u2019s \u201cinner space.\u201d\n* Accessory organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. They are considered accessory organs since they are not actually part of the intestinal tract itself, but have ducts that deliver digestive juices into the tract to help aid in digestion. There are four accessory organs: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. All of these organs secrete fluids containing a variety of chemicals such as enzymes and acids that aid in digestion.\nFigure 3.9. An overview of the organs involved in digestion. The parts of the GI tract are highlighted in blue, and the accessory organs are highlighted in yellow.",

    "document":"[ns_232] Given the importance of energy\u2019s role in sustaining life, it\u2019s not surprising that energy balance is tightly regulated by complex physiological processes. A region in the brain called the hypothalamus is the main control center for hunger and satiety. There is a constant dialogue between our brains and gastrointestinal tracts through hormonal and neural signals, which determine if we feel hungry or full. The hypothalamus can sense nutrient levels in the blood, and when nutrient levels are low, the hunger center is stimulated. Conversely, when nutrient levels are high, the satiety center is stimulated.\nFigure 7.6. The hypothalamus, shown in blue, is about the size of an almond and serves as the hunger center of the brain, receiving signals from the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, and blood and signaling hunger and satiety.\nHunger is the physiological need to eat. When the stomach is empty, it contracts and starts to grumble and growl. The stomach\u2019s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus. (Of course, the stomach also contracts when it\u2019s full and hard at work digesting food, but we can\u2019t hear these movements as well because the stomach\u2019s contents muffle the noise.) The stomach is also the main organ that produces and secretes the \u201chunger hormone,\u201d ghrelin, the only gut hormone found to increase hunger. Ghrelin levels are high before a meal and fall quickly once nutrients are absorbed.3\nAppetite is the psychological desire to eat. Satiety is the sensation of feeling full. After you eat a meal, the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. There are many hormones that are associated with satiety, and various organs secrete these hormones, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an example of one of these satiety hormones and is secreted in response to nutrients in the gut, especially fat and protein. In addition to inhibiting food intake, CCK stimulates pancreatic secretions, gall bladder contractions, and intestinal motility\u2014all of which aide in the digestion of nutrients.3\nAdipose tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Adipose is the primary organ that produces the hormone leptin, and as fat stores increase, more leptin is produced. Higher levels of leptin communicate to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. Leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure. The discovery of leptin\u2019s functions sparked excitement in the research world and the weight loss industry, as it was hypothesized that leptin might be used as a weight loss drug to decrease food intake. In several clinical trials, it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it. Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person, there is generally no sustained effect on food intake.4\nFigure 7.7. The structure of the hormone leptin (left), which is primarily produced by adipose tissue. The obese mouse in the photo has a gene mutation that makes it unable to produce leptin, resulting in constant hunger, lethargy, and severe obesity. For comparison, a mouse with normal leptin production is also shown. Such gene mutations are rare, but they serve as a dramatic illustration of the importance of the hormone in signaling energy balance.",

    "document":"[ns_382] Fluoride is a trace mineral needed in very small amounts in the body. It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn\u2019t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride\u2019s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\nFluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\n* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\n* Preventing demineralization of teeth\n* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\nAs a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\nFluoride\u2019s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water.",

    "document":"[ns_444] Although protein accounts for only about 5% of energy expended, dietary protein is necessary to support metabolic reactions that generate ATP, which rely heavily on proteins such as enzymes and transport proteins. Additional protein also helps muscles with maintenance, growth, and repair. For these reasons, athletes have higher protein needs than the general population. It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g\/kg\/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\nIt is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body\u2019s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\nIn addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g\/kg\/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g\/kg\/day for muscle synthesis.3\nAlthough athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements. Here are some examples of snacks or small meals that contain at least 15 to 25 grams of protein4:\n* \u00bd cup of granola plus \u00bc cup almonds (16 grams protein)\n* 7 oz. Greek yogurt (20 grams protein)\n* Peanut butter sandwich (20 grams protein)\n* 2 scrambled eggs and 1 cup of milk (20 grams protein)\n* 3 oz. canned tuna (\u00bd can) with \u00bd cup crackers (22 grams protein)\n* Turkey and cheese sandwich (32 grams protein)\nThese whole food options have the benefit of coming packaged with other nutrients, including carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, fiber, and micronutrients, and are often less costly than most protein supplements. Like all dietary supplements, protein shakes and other supplements are not well-regulated; some contain unnecessary additives such as sweeteners and herbs, and some have been found to contain unsafe levels of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury.

Most nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, but some urea is also contained in feces. Nitrogen is also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to balance the amount of protein used by the body, measured as the amount of nitrogen lost from the body.

Most healthy adults are in nitrogen balance. If more protein is consumed than needed, this extra protein is used for energy, and the nitrogen waste that results is excreted.

However, while saturated fats have a historical reputation for being unhealthy, more recent research has suggested that the link between saturated fat and heart disease may not be as clear cut as we once thought.\nThe BMJ\u2019s analysis on dietary fat and heart health explains the complicated relationship as such:\n> \u201cSynergism and interactions between different components of foods together with the degree of processing and preparation or cooking methods lead to a \u2018food matrix\u2019 effect which is not captured by considering single nutrients. Different types of food that are high in saturated fats are likely to have different effects on health. For example, dairy products and processed meats, both high in saturated fats, are differentially associated with many health outcomes in prospective epidemiological studies, often in opposite directions. One explanation for this divergence is that despite their similar fat content, other components of these two food groups are associated with different health effects. For example, dairy products contain minerals such as calcium and magnesium and have probiotic features if fermented, whereas processed red meat has a high salt and preservative content.\n> \n> \n> To produce public health guidelines on which foods to eat or avoid to reduce the risk of chronic disease is complicated because dietary fats are typically mixtures of different types of fatty acids.

Bile, which is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts have both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, so they are attracted to both fats and water. This makes them effective emulsifiers, meaning that they break large fat globules into smaller droplets. Emulsification makes lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes by increasing the surface area for them to act (see Fig. 5.22 below).\nThe pancreas secretes pancreatic lipases into the small intestine to enzymatically digest triglycerides. Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids, monoglycerides (glycerol backbone with one fatty acid still attached), and some free glycerol. Cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins do not need to be enzymatically digested (see Fig. 5.22 below).\nVIDEO: \u201cBile and Emulsification\u201d by Fuse School \u2013 Global Education, YouTube (May 26, 2020), 3:35 minutes.",

Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.\nFigure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.\nOnce inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.\nChylomicrons are one type of lipoprotein\u2014transport vehicles for lipids in blood and lymph.

    "query":"what are the names of the two hormones involved in blood calcium regulation and which gland produces each",
    "document":"[ns_369] Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Most of the body\u2019s calcium\u2014more than 99% of it\u2014is stored in bone, where it\u2019s important for bone strength and structure. The remaining 1% of the body\u2019s calcium is found in the blood and soft tissues, but it is here that calcium performs its most critical functions. For example, calcium is required for the transmission of every nerve impulse, electrical signals sent from one nerve cell to another. It\u2019s also required for every cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. With inadequate calcium, muscles can\u2019t relax, and instead become stiff and contract involuntarily, a condition known as tetany. Calcium also plays vital roles in blood pressure regulation, blood clotting, enzyme activation, hormone secretion, and signaling between cells.1\nThe many roles of calcium around the body are critical to daily survival, so maintaining homeostasis, or a steady state, of blood calcium levels is a high priority. The body rigorously controls blood calcium levels in a very tight range. If blood calcium drops, your body initiates several mechanisms to restore homeostasis, including drawing calcium from the bone. While the calcium stored in bone is important for long-term strength and structure of bone, it also serves as a calcium reserve that can be drawn upon to support the vital functions of calcium in the body, should blood calcium drop too low.\nTwo endocrine glands are key players in the regulation of blood calcium concentrations: the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It secretes a hormone called calcitonin. There are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea and located at the back of the thyroid gland. They secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).\nFigure 9.4. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located at the back of the neck.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how the body regulates blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium concentration drops too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH then acts in several ways to increase blood calcium levels:\n1. PTH stimulates the activity of osteoclasts to release calcium from bone.\n2. PTH acts on the kidney to reduce the amount of calcium lost in the urine, returning more to circulation.\n3. PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that convert vitamin D to its active form, also called calcitriol. Activated vitamin D acts on the intestine to increase the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D also works together with PTH to stimulate release of calcium from the bone and reduce calcium loss in urine.\nOnce blood calcium levels are normal, PTH levels drop, turning off all of these mechanisms of increasing calcium.\nOn the other hand, if blood calcium levels become too high, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits the release of calcium from the bone and increases calcium excretion from the kidneys. These mechanisms help to restore normal blood calcium concentrations, after which calcitonin levels drop again.\nFigure 9.5. Blood calcium (Ca2+) levels are tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin.\nThrough these two opposing pathways\u2014PTH and vitamin D for raising blood calcium and calcitonin for lowering blood calcium\u2014the body can very effectively maintain blood calcium homeostasis. This system is dependent upon stored calcium in bone, which is sacrificed when needed to ensure adequate blood calcium. In the short-term, this isn\u2019t a problem, because bone remodeling allows you to replace calcium in the bone. However, in the long-term, inadequate dietary calcium means you continuously draw down the calcium stores in your bones, resulting in declining bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture.\nCalcium requirements are highest for children and adolescents, who are growing and building bones, and for older adults, who are losing bone density.",

    "document":"[ns_477] The World Health Organization recommends that babies begin eating some solid foods at 6 months while continuing to breastfeed. Other health organizations offer more flexible advice, recommending that solid foods be introduced sometime between 4 and 6 months, depending on the baby\u2019s development, interest in eating solids, and family preferences. Regardless, most babies aren\u2019t ready to eat solid foods before 4 months, and starting too soon may increase the risk of obesity. Yet it\u2019s also important not to start solids too late, as beyond 6 months, breast milk alone can\u2019t support a baby\u2019s nutrient requirements.1\nHowever, as babies begin to eat solids, breast milk or formula continue to be the nutritional foundation of the diet. This period is also called complementary feeding, because solid foods are meant to complement the nutrients provided by breast milk or formula. Between 6 and 12 months, babies gradually eat more solid foods and less milk so that by 12 months, formula is no longer needed. Breastfeeding mothers may choose to wean at 12 months or continue breastfeeding as long as she and the baby like.\nBabies should be developmentally ready to eat solids before trying their first foods. A baby ready for solids should be able to do the following:1\n* Sit up without support (e.g., in a high chair or lap)\n* Open mouth for a spoonful of food and swallow it without gagging or pushing it back out\n* Reach for and grasp food or toys and bring them to his or her mouth\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends beginning with iron-rich foods such as pureed meat or iron-fortified cereal (e.g., rice cereal, oatmeal), as iron is usually the most limiting nutrient at this age, particularly for exclusively breastfed babies. Once these foods are introduced, others can gradually be added to the diet, introducing one at a time to keep an eye out for allergic reactions. Work up to a variety of foods from all of the food groups, as babies are willing to try just about anything at this stage, and this is an opportunity for them to learn about different flavors. You can also gradually increase texture, from pureed to mashed food, then lumpy foods to soft finger foods. By 12 months, most babies can eat most of the foods at the family table, with some modifications to avoid choking hazards.1,2\nWhen choosing good complementary foods, there are three main goals: (1) to meet nutrient requirements; (2) to introduce potentially allergenic foods; and (3) to support your baby in learning to eat many different flavors and textures. Parents should be sure to include the following:1,2\n* Good sources of iron and zinc, as both minerals can be limiting for breastfed infants. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified cereal. Beans, whole grains, and green vegetables add smaller amounts of iron.\n* Adequate fat to support babies\u2019 rapid growth and brain development. Good sources include whole fat yogurt, avocado, nut butters, and olive oil for cooking vegetables. Fish is also a great food for babies, because it provides both iron and fat, and it\u2019s a good source of omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, which support brain development.\n* A variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, so that your baby learns to like many different tastes and textures. It may take babies and toddlers 8 to 10 exposures of a new food before they learn to like it, so don\u2019t be discouraged if your baby doesn\u2019t like some foods right away.\nThere is no need to avoid giving your baby common food allergens, such as peanut, egg, dairy, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, or tree nuts. In fact, studies indicate that introducing at least some of these foods during the first year can prevent food allergies from developing. The evidence is strongest for peanut allergy.",

    "document":"[ns_38] In addition to its role in digestion, the GI tract serves an important immune function. Intestinal cells form the barrier between the interior of the body and the lumen, or tube, of the GI tract, which is technically outside of the body and teeming with potential pathogens. Immune tissue in the GI tract and other parts of the body produce immune cells that target foreign invaders, in part through the production of antibodies, protective proteins that bind to foreign substances. However, this function requires the immune system to accurately distinguish between normal food proteins and invading pathogens. A food allergy\u00a0is what happens if the immune system mistakenly identifies a food protein as an invasive threat.\nThe most common type of food allergy involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to a specific substance, orallergen. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur immediately after consuming the food (i.e., within seconds to minutes), although reactions can sometimes be delayed by two hours or more. Because an allergic reaction is caused by the immune system, it can lead to symptoms all over the body, including skin rashes; swollen lips, face, or throat; wheezing and difficulty breathing; nausea and vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; and rarely, a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction involving more than one organ system\u2014a rash coupled with difficulty breathing, for example\u2014is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately with epinephrine, commonly administered by injection with a device such as an EpiPen, and then person should seek immediate medical attention.1\nFigure 3.19. Common food allergens: peanuts, dairy, wheat, eggs, and shrimp. At right, an EpiPen, containing injectable epinephrine, is pictured. \nThe most common food allergies in the U.S. are caused by proteins in peanuts, tree nuts, milk, shellfish, eggs, fish, wheat, soy and sesame.4,5 A 2019 study reported that 19% of adults in the U.S. believe they\u2019re allergic to at least one food. After asking people about their symptoms, the researchers estimated that the true incidence of food allergies is closer to 11%, while the remaining 8% of people likely have a food intolerance.4\nFood allergies are common in children, affecting about 8% of U.S. children, although allergies can also develop later in life.5 It\u2019s common for young children to outgrow allergies to egg, dairy, wheat, or soy, but peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are often lifelong. Recent research has found that letting babies eat common food allergens, particularly peanut products, can prevent the development of allergies, perhaps by allowing the immune system an early opportunity to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens.6\nIf you think you may have a food allergy, it\u2019s important to see an allergist to ensure you have an accurate diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed based on symptoms after consuming a food, specific IgE blood tests, and\/or skin prick tests, where a tiny amount of food protein is scratched onto the skin to test for a reaction. Blood and skin tests determine whether a person is sensitized to an allergen, meaning that they\u2019re producing IgE antibodies to the food. However, the presence of IgE antibodies doesn\u2019t definitively mean a person has a food allergy; it\u2019s common to have a positive IgE test but still be able to eat the food without symptoms. The gold standard test for diagnosing is an oral food challenge\u2014consuming a small amount of the food and watching for signs of a reaction\u2014although due to time, cost, and risk, these are not always conducted. If you are diagnosed with a food allergy, you will be counseled to strictly avoid the food and carry injectable epinephrine in case of accidental consumption.",
    "transformed_document":"Introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies during their first year of life can help prevent the development of allergies, allowing the immune system to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens. This is because the immune system is still developing and is more likely to learn to tolerate common allergens if exposed to them early on, reducing the risk of lifelong allergies."
