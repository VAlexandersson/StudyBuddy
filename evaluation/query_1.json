            "document": "Starch\u00a0is made up of long chains of glucose. If these chains are straight, they\u2019re called amylose; if they\u2019re branched, they\u2019re called amylopectin.\nHere is an amylose segment containing 3 glucose units.\nThe next figure shows an amylopectin segment containing 4 glucose units. The chemical structure is represented differently, but can you spot the place where it branches?\nUsing our green hexagon to represent glucose, you can picture starch as something like this:\nHumans have digestive enzymes to break down both types of starch, which we\u2019ll discuss on the next page.\nStarch is the storage form of carbohydrate in plants. Plants make starch in order to store glucose. For example, starch is in seeds to give the seedling energy to sprout, and we eat those seeds in the form of grains, legumes (soybeans, lentils, pinto and kidney beans, for example), nuts, and seeds. Starch is also stored in roots and tubers to provide stored energy for the plant to grow and reproduce, and we eat these in the form of potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, and turnips.\nWhen we eat plant foods with starch, we can break it down into glucose to provide fuel for our body\u2019s cells. In addition, starch from whole plant foods comes packaged with other valuable nutrients. We also find refined starch\u2014such as corn starch\u2014as an ingredient in many processed foods, because it serves as a good thickener."
