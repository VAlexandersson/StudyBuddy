      "QUERY: what is the name of the muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach and does any chemical digestion occur there\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_21\n",
      "The esophagus is a muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach. No chemical digestion occurs while the bolus is mechanically propelled through this tube by peristalsis.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_18\n",
      "The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\n",
      "The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication (chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\n",
      "Food (now called a bolus since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\n",
      "Figure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\n",
      "Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\n",
      "Figure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\n",
      "In chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\n",
      "Video: Enzyme Action and the Hydrolysis of Sucrose by McGraw-Hill Animations, YouTube (June 3, 2017). 1:46 minutes.\n",
      "Nutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen (or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\n",
      "In excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_17\n",
      "The function of the digestive system is to break down the foods you eat, release their nutrients, and absorb those nutrients into the body. Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital contribution to this process.\n",
      "The easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories: the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs.\n",
      "* The GI tract is a one-way tube about 25 feet in length, beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. Between these two points, the GI tract also contains the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and the rectum. The small intestine is comprised of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The large intestine, also called the colon, is similarly divided into three sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. Both the mouth and anus are open to the external environment; thus, food and wastes within the GI tract are technically considered to be outside the body. Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body’s “inner space.”\n",
      "* Accessory organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. They are considered accessory organs since they are not actually part of the intestinal tract itself, but have ducts that deliver digestive juices into the tract to help aid in digestion. There are four accessory organs: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. All of these organs secrete fluids containing a variety of chemicals such as enzymes and acids that aid in digestion.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_202\n",
      "The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach from the esophagus. As illustrated in the image below, both mechanical and chemical digestion take place in the stomach. The stomach releases gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate the chemical digestion of protein. Muscular contractions, called peristalsis, also aid in digestion. The powerful stomach contractions churn the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture, which is called chyme.\n",
      "Fig. 6.18. Protein digestion in the stomach\n",
      "Because of the hydrochloric acid in the stomach, it has a very low pH of 1.5-3.5. The acidity of the stomach causes food proteins to denature, unfolding their three-dimensional structure to reveal just the polypeptide chain. This is the first step of chemical digestion of proteins. Recall that the three-dimensional structure of a protein is essential to its function, so denaturation in the stomach also destroys protein function. (This is why a protein such as insulin can’t be taken as an oral medication. Its function is destroyed in the digestive tract, first by denaturation and then further by enzymatic digestion. Instead, it has to be injected so that it is absorbed intact into the bloodstream.)\n",
      "Fig. 6.19. In the stomach, proteins are denatured because of the acidity of hydrochloric acid.\n",
      "Once proteins are denatured in the stomach, the peptide bonds linking amino acids together are more accessible for enzymatic digestion. That process is started by pepsin, an enzyme that is secreted by the cells that line the stomach and is activated by hydrochloric acid. Pepsin begins breaking peptide bonds, creating shorter polypeptides.\n",
      "Fig. 6.20. Enzymatic digestion of proteins begins in the stomach with the action of the enzyme pepsin. \n",
      "Proteins are large globular molecules, and their chemical breakdown requires time and mixing. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion. Eating a high-protein meal increases the amount of time required to sufficiently break down the meal in the stomach. Food remains in the stomach longer, making you feel full longer.\n",

      "Most of the nutrients from the peanut butter and jelly sandwich have now been digested and absorbed. Any components that still remain (usually less than ten percent of food consumed) and the indigestible fiber move from the small intestine to the large intestine (colon). A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the remaining water. Water is present not only from the solid foods and beverages consumed, but also the digestive juices released by the stomach and pancreas. As water is reabsorbed, liquid chyme becomes a semisolid, referred to as feces. Feces is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested substances, millions of bacteria, old cells from the lining of the GI tract, inorganic salts, and enough water to let it pass smoothly out of the body.\n",
      "Feces is stored in the rectum (a temporary holding area) until it is expelled through the anus via defecation. No further chemical breakdown of food takes place in the large intestine except that accomplished by the bacteria that inhabit this portion of the GI tract. There are trillions of bacteria residing in the large intestine (referred to as the bacterial flora), exceeding the total number of cells in the human body. This may seem rather unpleasant, but the great majority of bacteria in the large intestine are harmless and many are even beneficial—facilitating chemical digestion and absorption, improving immune function, and synthesizing vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K.\n",

      "Maltose is made of two glucose molecules bonded together. It doesn’t occur naturally in any appreciable amount in foods, with one exception: sprouted grains. Grains contain a lot of starch, which is made of long chains of glucose (more on this in a minute), and when the seed of a grain starts to sprout, it begins to break down that starch, creating maltose. If bread is made from those sprouted grains, that bread will have some maltose. Sprouted grain bread is usually a little heavier and sweeter than bread made from regular flour.\n",
      "Maltose also plays a role in the production of beer and liquor, because this process involves the fermentation of grains or other carbohydrate sources. Maltose is formed during the breakdown of those carbohydrates, but there is very little remaining once the fermentation process is complete.\n",
      "You can taste the sweetness of maltose if you hold a starchy food in your mouth for a minute or so. Try this with a simple food like a soda cracker. Starch is not sweet, but as the starch in the cracker begins to break down with the action of salivary amylase, maltose will form, and you’ll taste the sweetness!\n",

This fundamental difference in structure has a profound impact on how these starches are digested by humans.\n",

      "Amylose, with its linear structure, is relatively easy to digest, as enzymes can access and break down the glucose units with ease. In contrast, amylopectin's branched structure makes it more resistant to enzymatic digestion, requiring more time and effort for enzymes to access and break down the glucose units. This difference in digestibility is a crucial aspect of how our bodies process starches, as it affects the rate and efficiency of glucose absorption and energy production.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_119\n",
      "Fats help the body to produce and regulate hormones. For example, adipose tissue secretes the hormone leptin, which signals the body’s energy status and helps to regulate appetite. Fat is also required for reproductive health; a woman who lacks adequate amounts may stop menstruating and be unable to conceive until her body can store more energy as fat. Omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids help regulate cholesterol and blood clotting and control inflammation in the joints, tissues, and bloodstream. Fats also play important functional roles in sustaining nerve impulse transmission, memory storage, and tissue structure. Lipids are especially focal to brain activity in structure and in function, helping to form nerve cell membranes, insulate neurons, and facilitate the signaling of electrical impulses throughout the brain.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_232\n",
      "Given the importance of energy’s role in sustaining life, it’s not surprising that energy balance is tightly regulated by complex physiological processes. A region in the brain called the hypothalamus is the main control center for hunger and satiety. There is a constant dialogue between our brains and gastrointestinal tracts through hormonal and neural signals, which determine if we feel hungry or full. The hypothalamus can sense nutrient levels in the blood, and when nutrient levels are low, the hunger center is stimulated. Conversely, when nutrient levels are high, the satiety center is stimulated.\n",
      "Figure 7.6. The hypothalamus, shown in blue, is about the size of an almond and serves as the hunger center of the brain, receiving signals from the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, and blood and signaling hunger and satiety.\n",
      "Hunger is the physiological need to eat. When the stomach is empty, it contracts and starts to grumble and growl. The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus. (Of course, the stomach also contracts when it’s full and hard at work digesting food, but we can’t hear these movements as well because the stomach’s contents muffle the noise.) The stomach is also the main organ that produces and secretes the “hunger hormone,” ghrelin, the only gut hormone found to increase hunger. Ghrelin levels are high before a meal and fall quickly once nutrients are absorbed.3\n",
      "Appetite is the psychological desire to eat. Satiety is the sensation of feeling full. After you eat a meal, the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. There are many hormones that are associated with satiety, and various organs secrete these hormones, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an example of one of these satiety hormones and is secreted in response to nutrients in the gut, especially fat and protein. In addition to inhibiting food intake, CCK stimulates pancreatic secretions, gall bladder contractions, and intestinal motility—all of which aide in the digestion of nutrients.3\n",
      "Adipose tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Adipose is the primary organ that produces the hormone leptin, and as fat stores increase, more leptin is produced. Higher levels of leptin communicate to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. Leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked excitement in the research world and the weight loss industry, as it was hypothesized that leptin might be used as a weight loss drug to decrease food intake. In several clinical trials, it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it. Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person, there is generally no sustained effect on food intake.4\n",
      "Figure 7.7. The structure of the hormone leptin (left), which is primarily produced by adipose tissue. The obese mouse in the photo has a gene mutation that makes it unable to produce leptin, resulting in constant hunger, lethargy, and severe obesity. For comparison, a mouse with normal leptin production is also shown. Such gene mutations are rare, but they serve as a dramatic illustration of the importance of the hormone in signaling energy balance.\n",

      "A tissue is a group of many similar cells that share a common structure and work together to perform a specific function. There are four basic types of human tissues: connective tissue, which connects tissues; epithelial tissue, which lines and protects organs; muscle, which contracts for movement and support; and nerve, which responds and reacts to signals in the environment.\n",
      "An organ is a group of similar tissues arranged in a specific manner to perform a specific physiological function. Examples include the brain, liver, and heart. An organ systemis a group of two or more organs that work together to perform a specific physiological function. Examples include the digestive system and central nervous system.\n",
      "There are eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (Figure 3.3). Assigning organs to organ systems can be imprecise since organs that “belong” to one system can also have functions integral to another system. In fact, many organs contribute to more than one system. And most of these organ systems are involved in nutrition-related functions within the body (Table 3.1). For example, the cardiovascular system plays a role in nutrition by transporting nutrients in the blood to the cells of the body. The endocrine system produces hormones, many of which are involved in regulating appetite, digestive processes, and nutrient levels in the blood. Even the reproductive system plays a role in providing nutrition to a developing fetus or growing baby.\n",

      "The excess energy from the food we eat is incorporated into adipose tissue, or fatty tissue. Most of the energy required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates unit, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of energy, it is quite bulky with heavy water content, so the body cannot store much of it for long. Fats, on the other hand, can serve as a larger and more long-term energy reserve. Fats pack together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with energy, containing more than double the amount of energy as a gram of carbohydrate.\n",
      "We draw on the energy stored in fat to help meet our basic energy needs when we’re at rest and to fuel our muscles for movement throughout the day, from walking to class, playing with our kids, dancing through dinner prep, or powering through a shift at work. Historically, when humans relied on hunting and gathering wild foods or on the success of agricultural crops, having the ability to store energy as fat was vital to survival through lean times. Hunger remains a problem for people around the world, and being able to store energy when times are good can help them endure a period of food insecurity. In other cases, the energy stored in adipose tissue might allow a person to weather a long illness.\n",
      "Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost indefinitely in size. An overabundance of adipose tissue can be detrimental to your health not only from mechanical stress on the body due to excess weight, but also from hormonal and metabolic changes. Obesity can increase the risk for many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and certain types of cancer. It can also interfere with reproduction, cognitive function, and mood. Thus, while some body fat is critical to our survival and good health, in large quantities it can be a deterrent to maintaining good health.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_382\n",
      "Fluoride is a trace mineral needed in very small amounts in the body. It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn’t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride’s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\n",
      "Fluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\n",
      "* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\n",
      "* Preventing demineralization of teeth\n",
      "* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\n",
      "As a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\n",
      "Fluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water.\n",

      "* Obesity\n",
      "* Type 2 diabetes\n",
      "* Some cancers\n",
      "* Dental cavities\n",
      "Why does too much added sugar cause health problems? The reasons are complex, and this is an ongoing area of research and controversy. One possible explanation is that a diet high in added sugar means the pancreas has to work hard to make enough insulin, and over time, it can begin to fail and the body’s cells start to become insulin resistant. The liver also has to work hard to metabolize fructose, and too much fructose increases fat synthesis, which can raise blood lipid and cholesterol levels, increasing risk of heart disease.\n",
      "Both dietary sucrose and starch are associated with tooth decay. Bacteria living in the mouth can utilize the carbohydrates passing through the oral cavity for their own benefit. Those bacteria happily metabolize carbohydrates, especially sucrose, but also starchy foods, which stick to teeth and linger there. Acid is formed in the process, and this can dissolve your tooth enamel, eventually causing cavities, also known as dental caries. Reducing sugar intake, limiting between-meal snacks, and brushing after meals to remove lingering carbohydrates can help reduce the risk of dental caries. The use of fluoride and regular dental care also help.\n",
      "Fig. 4.36. Dental caries are formed because of a combination of factors: the presence of oral bacteria; a supply of sugar and/or starch for them to eat; tooth surface where they can form colonies, or plaque; and time.\n",

      "However, as with all minerals, fluoride can also be quite toxic if consumed in excessive amounts. Acute toxicity symptoms from large intakes of fluoride include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity results in an irreversible condition known as fluorosis, characterized by the mottling (i.e., white speckling) and pitting of the teeth (see Figure 9.10). Fluorosis is primarily a risk in children, because mineralization of permanent teeth has typically occurred by age 8.6\n",

Other beverages with a high amount of fluoride include teas and grape juice. Solid foods do not generally contain a large amount of fluoride, although this depends on the fluoride level of the soil and water it was grown in and whether it was cooked with fluoridated water. Canned meats and fish that contain bones do contain some fluoride. Other good non-dietary sources are fluoridated toothpaste and dental rinses.\n",

      "Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.\n",
      "In dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.\n",
      "Vitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations—chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person’s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\n",
      "Recall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we’ll discuss later on this page.\n",
      "Figure 9.11. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin (vitamin D3) or provided in the diet (vitamin D2 or D3). It is converted by reactions occurring first in the liver (making calcidiol) and then kidney (making calcitriol, the active form). Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.\n",
      "Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1\n",

      "Another mechanism by which fluoride combats tooth decay is by preventing demineralization of teeth [ns_382]. When bacteria produce acid, it can dissolve the minerals in tooth enamel, leading to the formation of cavities. Fluoride helps to prevent this demineralization by binding to the tooth enamel and making it more resistant to acid attacks. This is because fluoride ions can replace the hydroxide ions in the enamel, making it more difficult for the acid to dissolve the minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, fluoride also enhances remineralization of destroyed enamel [ns_382]. Remineralization is the process by which minerals are redeposited onto the tooth surface, reversing the effects of demineralization. Fluoride helps to facilitate this process by increasing the solubility of minerals in the saliva, making it easier for them to be redeposited onto the tooth surface. Additionally, fluoride can also help to stimulate the production of saliva, which is rich in minerals that can help to remineralize the teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, fluoride combats tooth decay through three primary mechanisms: blocking acid formation by bacteria, preventing demineralization of teeth, and enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel. By understanding these mechanisms, we can better appreciate the importance of fluoride in maintaining good oral health and preventing tooth decay.\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_193\n",
      "Because our bodies are so efficient at recycling amino acids, protein needs are not as high as carbohydrate and fat needs. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for a sedentary adult is 0.8 g per kg body weight per day. This would mean that a 165-pound man and a 143-pound woman would need 60 g and 52 g of protein per day, respectively. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is 10% to 35% of total energy intake. A Tolerable Upper Intake Limit for protein has not been set, but it is recommended that you not exceed the upper end of the AMDR.\n",
      "Protein needs are higher for the following populations:\n",
      "* growing children and adolescents\n",
      "* women who are pregnant (they’re using protein to help grow a fetus)\n",
      "* lactating women (breast milk has protein in it for the baby’s nutrition, so mothers need more protein to synthesize that milk)\n",
      "* athletes\n",
      "The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day for athletes, depending on the type of training.1 Higher intakes may be needed for short periods during intensified training or with reduced energy intake.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_444\n",
      "Although protein accounts for only about 5% of energy expended, dietary protein is necessary to support metabolic reactions that generate ATP, which rely heavily on proteins such as enzymes and transport proteins. Additional protein also helps muscles with maintenance, growth, and repair. For these reasons, athletes have higher protein needs than the general population. It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\n",
      "It is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body’s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\n",
      "In addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g/kg/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g/kg/day for muscle synthesis.3\n",
      "Although athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements. Here are some examples of snacks or small meals that contain at least 15 to 25 grams of protein4:\n",
      "* ½ cup of granola plus ¼ cup almonds (16 grams protein)\n",
      "* 7 oz. Greek yogurt (20 grams protein)\n",
      "* Peanut butter sandwich (20 grams protein)\n",

      "* Turkey and cheese sandwich (32 grams protein)\n",
      "These whole food options have the benefit of coming packaged with other nutrients, including carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, fiber, and micronutrients, and are often less costly than most protein supplements. Like all dietary supplements, protein shakes and other supplements are not well-regulated; some contain unnecessary additives such as sweeteners and herbs, and some have been found to contain unsafe levels of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury.

      "A healthy diet incorporates all nutrients in moderation, meaning that there’s neither too little nor too much. As with all nutrients, having too little or too much protein can have health consequences.\n",
      "The AMDR for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent of kilocalories.1 That’s a fairly wide range, and it encompasses typical protein intakes of many traditional human cultures.\n",
      "Fig. 6.22. Diverse human cultures have survived on different levels of dietary protein. The photo on the left shows Inuit families sharing frozen, aged walrus meat. Their traditional diet is very dependent on meat and high in both protein and fat. On the right is a traditional vegetarian meal in India, high in carbohydrates but still providing adequate levels of protein. \n",
      "Protein intake below the RDA is inadequate to support the body’s needs for synthesis of structural and functional proteins. On the other hand, there are some concerns that high protein intake is associated with chronic disease. However, as we’ll discuss, it’s not just the quantity of protein that matters, but also the nutritional package that it comes in.\n",
      "According to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, most Americans get enough protein, averaging about 88 grams per day and 14 to 16 percent of caloric intake. The study also found that diets with protein above 35 percent of caloric intake, the upper end of the AMDR, were extremely rare.2\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_210\n",
      "When the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine wrote the DRI for macronutrients, published in 2005, they concluded that there wasn’t enough evidence to establish an Upper Limit for protein. The high end of the AMDR, 35 percent of kilocalories for protein, was set in order to allow the total diet to be well-balanced with carbohydrate and fat.1 Higher levels of protein intake haven’t been well-studied, but over the years, there have been many concerns with high protein diets. However, current evidence indicates it’s large amounts of animal protein (particularly from red meat or processed meats) that can be problematic, not high amounts of protein per se.5\n",
      "For example, a diet containing lots of steak, bacon, and sausage would be high in protein, but it also might be high in saturated fat, cholesterol, salt, and nitrates. Eating more red meat and processed red meat is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer (especially colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and breast cancers). This link doesn’t seem to be caused by the protein but rather the nutritional package that it comes in. In addition, the link to cancer may be related to the carcinogens that can form when meat is cooked at high temperatures, particularly when it’s charred by grilling.5\n",
      "On the other hand, studies show that when protein comes from lean meat and plant sources, risk of chronic diseases may be reduced. For example, a 2015 study found that frequent consumption of red meat in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer later in life, whereas consuming poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts instead lowered risk.6 Other studies have shown that higher protein diets can reduce the risk of heart disease, provided the protein comes from healthier sources.\n",
      "Fig. 6.24. Compare several different “protein packages.” The steak and bacon provide protein but also large amounts of saturated fat and sodium. Salmon provides as much protein as the steak but with less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fats. Lentils are a good source of protein, are low in fat, and are a great source of fiber. \n",
      "Several other concerns about high protein diets haven’t turned out to be problematic after all:\n",
      "* Osteoporosis – High protein diets were once thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis, because researchers noticed that urinary calcium excretion increases when people consume high amounts of protein. However, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation found that this is not a concern, and some studies even show that higher protein intake is associated with greater bone mineral density.7\n",
      "* Kidney function – Another concern was that high protein diets would strain the kidneys because of the increased need to filter and excrete nitrogen. A 2018 meta-analysis concluded that this is not a concern. However, people who already have chronic kidney disease should avoid high protein diets and maintain protein intake around the RDA of 0.8 g/kg, a lower intake than many Americans are consuming.8 A 2009 study tested a very low protein diet of 0.6 g/kg protein per day in people with chronic kidney disease and found that it did not prevent the development of kidney failure but did increase the risk of death, underscoring the importance of adequate protein even in people with kidney disease.9\n",
      "From all of this research, there’s little evidence that a high protein diet is inherently harmful, so long as the protein doesn’t come packaged with a lot of saturated fat and red meat consumption is limited. Still, there’s little research directly testing the health effects of very high protein diets, including those achieved using protein supplements of purified protein, so it’s probably wise to keep protein balanced with the other macronutrients, focusing on whole foods from all the food groups.\n",

      "The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When amino acids are broken down, nitrogen is released. Most nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, but some urea is also contained in feces. Nitrogen is also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to balance the amount of protein used by the body, measured as the amount of nitrogen lost from the body. The Institute Of Medicine used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein.\n",
      "* Nitrogen Balance– A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen consumed equals the amount of nitrogen excreted. Most healthy adults are in nitrogen balance. If more protein is consumed than needed, this extra protein is used for energy, and the nitrogen waste that results is excreted. The lowest amount of protein a person can consume and still remain in nitrogen balance represents that person’s minimum protein requirement.\n",
      "Figure 6.14. People are in nitrogen balance when they excrete as much nitrogen as they consume.\n",
      "* Negative Nitrogen Balance– A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who is eating a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than they actually need.\n",
      "Figure 6.15. People are in negative nitrogen balance when they excrete more nitrogen than they consume, usually because they are not eating enough protein to meet their needs.\n",
      "* Positive Nitrogen Balance– A person is in positive nitrogen balance when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during pregnancy or growth in childhood. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.\n",

In a saturated fatty acid, each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, with single bonds between the carbons.\n",

This is referred to as a point of unsaturation, because the carbon is only bonded to one hydrogen atom instead of two.

However, while saturated fats have a historical reputation for being unhealthy, more recent research has suggested that the link between saturated fat and heart disease may not be as clear cut as we once thought.\n",

      "> “Synergism and interactions between different components of foods together with the degree of processing and preparation or cooking methods lead to a ‘food matrix’ effect which is not captured by considering single nutrients. Different types of food that are high in saturated fats are likely to have different effects on health. For example, dairy products and processed meats, both high in saturated fats, are differentially associated with many health outcomes in prospective epidemiological studies, often in opposite directions. One explanation for this divergence is that despite their similar fat content, other components of these two food groups are associated with different health effects. For example, dairy products contain minerals such as calcium and magnesium and have probiotic features if fermented, whereas processed red meat has a high salt and preservative content.\n",

Hence, conclusions about the health effects of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are unlikely to consistently translate to the health effects of the fats, oils, and foods in which those fatty acids are present.”\n",

      "However, the evidence base for monounsaturated fats is not as strong as the evidence base for replacement with polyunsaturated fats. Evidence has also shown that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates reduces blood levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, but increases blood levels of triglycerides and reduces high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol). Replacing total fat or saturated fats with carbohydrates is not associated with reduced risk of CVD. Additional research is needed to determine whether this relationship is consistent across categories of carbohydrates (e.g., whole versus refined grains; intrinsic versus added sugars), as they may have different associations with various health outcomes. Therefore, saturated fats in the diet should be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.”\n",
      "Dr. Krauss summed up the recommendations as such: “An overall eating pattern that emphasizes whole grains rather than refined carbs such as white flour, along with foods high in polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, seeds, nuts and vegetable oils, is of more value for reducing coronary heart disease risk than simply aiming to further reduce saturated fat.”\n",

      "DOCUMENT: ns_146\n",
      "As the stomach contents enter the small intestine, most of the dietary lipids are undigested and clustered in large droplets. Bile, which is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts have both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, so they are attracted to both fats and water. This makes them effective emulsifiers, meaning that they break large fat globules into smaller droplets. Emulsification makes lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes by increasing the surface area for them to act (see Fig. 5.22 below).\n",
      "The pancreas secretes pancreatic lipases into the small intestine to enzymatically digest triglycerides. Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids, monoglycerides (glycerol backbone with one fatty acid still attached), and some free glycerol. Cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins do not need to be enzymatically digested (see Fig. 5.22 below).\n",

      "Next, those products of fat digestion (fatty acids, monoglycerides, glycerol, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins) need to enter into the circulation so that they can be used by cells around the body. Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.\n",
      "Figure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.\n",
      "Once inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.\n",

      "Phospholipids are found in both plants and animals but make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids. However, they play many important roles in the body and in foods. Phospholipids can also be synthesized by the body, so they don’t have to be consumed in the diet.\n",
      "Phospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides (Figure 5.8). Like triglycerides, phospholipids have a glycerol backbone. But unlike triglycerides, phospholipids only have two fatty acid molecules attached to the glycerol backbone, while the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bonded to a phosphate group—a chemical group that contains the mineral phosphorus.\n",
      "Figure. 5.8. The structural difference between a triglyceride (on the left) and a phospholipid (on the right) is in the third carbon position, where the phospholipid contains a phosphate group instead of a fatty acid. \n",
      "The unique structure of phospholipids makes them both fat- and water-soluble, or amphiphilic. The fatty acids are hydrophobic (dislike water), and the phosphate group and glycerol are hydrophilic (attracted to water).\n",
      "Figure 5.9. A phospholipid molecule consists of a polar phosphate “head,” which is hydrophilic, and a non-polar lipid “tail,” which is hydrophobic. \n",
      "The amphiphilic nature of phospholipids makes them very useful for several functions in the body. Every cell in the body is encased in a membrane composed primarily of a double layer of phospholipids (also known as the phospholipid bilayer), which protects the inside of the cell from the outside environment while at the same time allowing for transport of fat and water through the membrane. Phospholipids also play a role in transporting fats in the blood, as we’ll learn later in this unit.\n",
      "Figure 5.10. The phospholipid bilayer consists of two adjacent sheets of phospholipids, arranged tail to tail. The hydrophobic tails associate with one another, forming the interior of the membrane. The polar heads contact the fluid inside and outside of the cell.\n",
      "Another important role of phospholipids is to act as emulsifiers. Emulsions are mixtures of two liquids that do not normally mix (oil and water, for example). Without an emulsifier, the oil and water separate out into two layers. Because of their ability to mix with both water and fat, phospholipids are ideal emulsifiers that can keep oil and water mixed, dispersing tiny oil droplets throughout the water. Lecithin—a phospholipid found in egg yolk, soybean, and wheat germ—is often used as a food emulsifier. Emulsifiers also play an important role in making food appetizing; their inclusion in foods like sauces and creams makes for a smoother texture and prevents the oil and water ingredients from separating out. They also can extend shelf life.\n",

      "Lipid digestion and absorption pose some special challenges. Triglycerides are large molecules, and unlike carbohydrates and proteins, they’re not water-soluble. Because of this, they like to cluster together in large droplets when they’re in a watery environment like the digestive tract. The digestive process has to break those large droplets of fat into smaller droplets and then enzymatically digest lipid molecules using enzymes called lipases. The mouth and stomach play a small role in this process, but most enzymatic digestion of lipids happens in the small intestine. From there, the products of lipid digestion are absorbed into circulation and transported around the body, which again requires some special handling since lipids are not water-soluble and do not mix with the watery blood.\n",
      "Let’s start at the beginning to learn more about the path of lipids through the digestive tract.\n",
      "GRADE: yes\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_18\n",
      "The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\n",
      "The first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication (chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\n",
      "Food (now called a bolus since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\n",
      "Figure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\n",
      "Digestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\n",
      "Figure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\n",
      "In chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\n",

      "Nutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen (or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\n",
      "In excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.\n",

      "QUERY: what are the names of the two hormones involved in blood calcium regulation and which gland produces each\n",
      "DOCUMENT: ns_369\n",
      "Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Most of the body’s calcium—more than 99% of it—is stored in bone, where it’s important for bone strength and structure. The remaining 1% of the body’s calcium is found in the blood and soft tissues, but it is here that calcium performs its most critical functions. For example, calcium is required for the transmission of every nerve impulse, electrical signals sent from one nerve cell to another. It’s also required for every cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. With inadequate calcium, muscles can’t relax, and instead become stiff and contract involuntarily, a condition known as tetany. Calcium also plays vital roles in blood pressure regulation, blood clotting, enzyme activation, hormone secretion, and signaling between cells.1\n",
      "The many roles of calcium around the body are critical to daily survival, so maintaining homeostasis, or a steady state, of blood calcium levels is a high priority. The body rigorously controls blood calcium levels in a very tight range. If blood calcium drops, your body initiates several mechanisms to restore homeostasis, including drawing calcium from the bone. While the calcium stored in bone is important for long-term strength and structure of bone, it also serves as a calcium reserve that can be drawn upon to support the vital functions of calcium in the body, should blood calcium drop too low.\n",
      "Two endocrine glands are key players in the regulation of blood calcium concentrations: the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It secretes a hormone called calcitonin. There are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea and located at the back of the thyroid gland. They secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n",
      "Figure 9.4. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located at the back of the neck.\n",
      "Let’s take a closer look at how the body regulates blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium concentration drops too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH then acts in several ways to increase blood calcium levels:\n",
      "1. PTH stimulates the activity of osteoclasts to release calcium from bone.\n",
      "2. PTH acts on the kidney to reduce the amount of calcium lost in the urine, returning more to circulation.\n",
      "3. PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that convert vitamin D to its active form, also called calcitriol. Activated vitamin D acts on the intestine to increase the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D also works together with PTH to stimulate release of calcium from the bone and reduce calcium loss in urine.\n",
      "Once blood calcium levels are normal, PTH levels drop, turning off all of these mechanisms of increasing calcium.\n",
      "On the other hand, if blood calcium levels become too high, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits the release of calcium from the bone and increases calcium excretion from the kidneys. These mechanisms help to restore normal blood calcium concentrations, after which calcitonin levels drop again.\n",
      "Figure 9.5. Blood calcium (Ca2+) levels are tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin.\n",
      "Through these two opposing pathways—PTH and vitamin D for raising blood calcium and calcitonin for lowering blood calcium—the body can very effectively maintain blood calcium homeostasis. This system is dependent upon stored calcium in bone, which is sacrificed when needed to ensure adequate blood calcium. In the short-term, this isn’t a problem, because bone remodeling allows you to replace calcium in the bone. However, in the long-term, inadequate dietary calcium means you continuously draw down the calcium stores in your bones, resulting in declining bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture.\n",
      "Calcium requirements are highest for children and adolescents, who are growing and building bones, and for older adults, who are losing bone density.\n",

      "Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.\n",
      "In dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.\n",
      "Vitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations—chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person’s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\n",
      "Recall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we’ll discuss later on this page.\n",

Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.\n",
      "Beyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1\n",

      "In the short-term, there are no obvious signs of calcium deficiency. This is because the body stores so much calcium in bones, and just 1% of total body calcium is required for daily functioning. If low blood calcium does occur, symptoms include muscle cramping, numbness and tingling in fingers, convulsions, lethargy, poor appetite, and abnormal heart rhythms. Without treatment, low blood calcium can lead to death.1\n",
      "Much more common is a long-term calcium deficiency, resulting from a continuous draw of calcium stores from the bone. This causes osteopenia, or low bone mass, which can lead to osteoporosis if untreated. Osteoporosis significantly increases a person’s risk of fractures. Nutrition surveys in the United States show that groups at greatest risk of dietary calcium inadequacy include adolescents and older adults, especially female teens and older women.1\n",
      "Too much calcium can also cause problems, although this is rarely caused by excessive intake of calcium from foods. Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland or a parathyroid tumor can cause high blood calcium, leading to calcification or hardening of blood vessels and soft tissue and the formation of kidney stones. High calcium intake from supplements has also been associated with increased risk of kidney stones, and in some studies, increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It can also cause constipation.1\n",

      "The World Health Organization recommends that babies begin eating some solid foods at 6 months while continuing to breastfeed. Other health organizations offer more flexible advice, recommending that solid foods be introduced sometime between 4 and 6 months, depending on the baby’s development, interest in eating solids, and family preferences. Regardless, most babies aren’t ready to eat solid foods before 4 months, and starting too soon may increase the risk of obesity. Yet it’s also important not to start solids too late, as beyond 6 months, breast milk alone can’t support a baby’s nutrient requirements.1\n",
      "However, as babies begin to eat solids, breast milk or formula continue to be the nutritional foundation of the diet. This period is also called complementary feeding, because solid foods are meant to complement the nutrients provided by breast milk or formula. Between 6 and 12 months, babies gradually eat more solid foods and less milk so that by 12 months, formula is no longer needed. Breastfeeding mothers may choose to wean at 12 months or continue breastfeeding as long as she and the baby like.\n",
      "Babies should be developmentally ready to eat solids before trying their first foods. A baby ready for solids should be able to do the following:1\n",
      "* Sit up without support (e.g., in a high chair or lap)\n",
      "* Open mouth for a spoonful of food and swallow it without gagging or pushing it back out\n",
      "* Reach for and grasp food or toys and bring them to his or her mouth\n",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends beginning with iron-rich foods such as pureed meat or iron-fortified cereal (e.g., rice cereal, oatmeal), as iron is usually the most limiting nutrient at this age, particularly for exclusively breastfed babies. Once these foods are introduced, others can gradually be added to the diet, introducing one at a time to keep an eye out for allergic reactions. Work up to a variety of foods from all of the food groups, as babies are willing to try just about anything at this stage, and this is an opportunity for them to learn about different flavors. You can also gradually increase texture, from pureed to mashed food, then lumpy foods to soft finger foods. By 12 months, most babies can eat most of the foods at the family table, with some modifications to avoid choking hazards.1,2\n",
      "When choosing good complementary foods, there are three main goals: (1) to meet nutrient requirements; (2) to introduce potentially allergenic foods; and (3) to support your baby in learning to eat many different flavors and textures. Parents should be sure to include the following:1,2\n",
      "* Good sources of iron and zinc, as both minerals can be limiting for breastfed infants. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified cereal. Beans, whole grains, and green vegetables add smaller amounts of iron.\n",
      "* Adequate fat to support babies’ rapid growth and brain development. Good sources include whole fat yogurt, avocado, nut butters, and olive oil for cooking vegetables. Fish is also a great food for babies, because it provides both iron and fat, and it’s a good source of omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, which support brain development.\n",
      "* A variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, so that your baby learns to like many different tastes and textures. It may take babies and toddlers 8 to 10 exposures of a new food before they learn to like it, so don’t be discouraged if your baby doesn’t like some foods right away.\n",

      "In addition to its role in digestion, the GI tract serves an important immune function. Intestinal cells form the barrier between the interior of the body and the lumen, or tube, of the GI tract, which is technically outside of the body and teeming with potential pathogens. Immune tissue in the GI tract and other parts of the body produce immune cells that target foreign invaders, in part through the production of antibodies, protective proteins that bind to foreign substances. However, this function requires the immune system to accurately distinguish between normal food proteins and invading pathogens. A food allergy is what happens if the immune system mistakenly identifies a food protein as an invasive threat.\n",
      "The most common type of food allergy involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to a specific substance, orallergen. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur immediately after consuming the food (i.e., within seconds to minutes), although reactions can sometimes be delayed by two hours or more. Because an allergic reaction is caused by the immune system, it can lead to symptoms all over the body, including skin rashes; swollen lips, face, or throat; wheezing and difficulty breathing; nausea and vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; and rarely, a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction involving more than one organ system—a rash coupled with difficulty breathing, for example—is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately with epinephrine, commonly administered by injection with a device such as an EpiPen, and then person should seek immediate medical attention.1\n",

      "The most common food allergies in the U.S. are caused by proteins in peanuts, tree nuts, milk, shellfish, eggs, fish, wheat, soy and sesame.4,5 A 2019 study reported that 19% of adults in the U.S. believe they’re allergic to at least one food. After asking people about their symptoms, the researchers estimated that the true incidence of food allergies is closer to 11%, while the remaining 8% of people likely have a food intolerance.4\n",
      "Food allergies are common in children, affecting about 8% of U.S. children, although allergies can also develop later in life.5 It’s common for young children to outgrow allergies to egg, dairy, wheat, or soy, but peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are often lifelong. Recent research has found that letting babies eat common food allergens, particularly peanut products, can prevent the development of allergies, perhaps by allowing the immune system an early opportunity to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens.6\n",
      "If you think you may have a food allergy, it’s important to see an allergist to ensure you have an accurate diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed based on symptoms after consuming a food, specific IgE blood tests, and/or skin prick tests, where a tiny amount of food protein is scratched onto the skin to test for a reaction. Blood and skin tests determine whether a person is sensitized to an allergen, meaning that they’re producing IgE antibodies to the food. However, the presence of IgE antibodies doesn’t definitively mean a person has a food allergy; it’s common to have a positive IgE test but still be able to eat the food without symptoms. The gold standard test for diagnosing is an oral food challenge—consuming a small amount of the food and watching for signs of a reaction—although due to time, cost, and risk, these are not always conducted. If you are diagnosed with a food allergy, you will be counseled to strictly avoid the food and carry injectable epinephrine in case of accidental consumption.\n",

There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication\\xa0(chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\\nFood (now called a bolus\\xa0since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis\\xa0consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\\nFigure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\\nDigestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion\\xa0is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\\nFigure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\\nIn chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes\\xa0are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis\\xa0is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\\nVideo: Enzyme Action and the Hydrolysis of Sucrose by McGraw-Hill Animations, YouTube (June 3, 2017). 1:46 minutes.\\nNutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen\\xa0(or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\\nIn excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.'},\n",

Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital contribution to this process.\\nThe easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories: the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs.\\n* The GI tract\\xa0is a one-way tube about 25 feet in length, beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. Between these two points, the GI tract also contains the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and the rectum. The small intestine is comprised of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The large intestine, also called the colon, is similarly divided into three sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. Both the mouth and anus are open to the external environment; thus, food and wastes within the GI tract are technically considered to be outside the body. Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body’s “inner space.”\\n* Accessory organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. They are considered accessory organs since they are not actually part of the intestinal tract itself, but have ducts that deliver digestive juices into the tract to help aid in digestion. There are four accessory organs: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. All of these organs secrete fluids containing a variety of chemicals such as enzymes and acids that aid in digestion.\\nFigure 3.9. An overview of the organs involved in digestion.

A region in the brain called the hypothalamus is the main control center for hunger and satiety. There is a constant dialogue between our brains and gastrointestinal tracts through hormonal and neural signals, which determine if we feel hungry or full. The hypothalamus can sense nutrient levels in the blood, and when nutrient levels are low, the hunger center is stimulated. Conversely, when nutrient levels are high, the satiety center is stimulated.\\nFigure 7.6. The hypothalamus, shown in blue, is about the size of an almond and serves as the hunger center of the brain, receiving signals from the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, and blood and signaling hunger and satiety.\\nHunger is the physiological need to eat. When the stomach is empty, it contracts and starts to grumble and growl. The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus. (Of course, the stomach also contracts when it’s full and hard at work digesting food, but we can’t hear these movements as well because the stomach’s contents muffle the noise.) The stomach is also the main organ that produces and secretes the “hunger hormone,” ghrelin, the only gut hormone found to increase hunger. Ghrelin levels are high before a meal and fall quickly once nutrients are absorbed.3\\nAppetite is the psychological desire to eat. Satiety is the sensation of feeling full. After you eat a meal, the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. There are many hormones that are associated with satiety, and various organs secrete these hormones, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an example of one of these satiety hormones and is secreted in response to nutrients in the gut, especially fat and protein. In addition to inhibiting food intake, CCK stimulates pancreatic secretions, gall bladder contractions, and intestinal motility—all of which aide in the digestion of nutrients.3\\nAdipose tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Adipose is the primary organ that produces the hormone leptin, and as fat stores increase, more leptin is produced. Higher levels of leptin communicate to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. Leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure. The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked excitement in the research world and the weight loss industry, as it was hypothesized that leptin might be used as a weight loss drug to decrease food intake. In several clinical trials, it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it. Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person, there is generally no sustained effect on food intake.4\\nFigure 7.7.

The obese mouse in the photo has a gene mutation that makes it unable to produce leptin, resulting in constant hunger, lethargy, and severe obesity.

It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn’t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride’s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\\nFluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\\n* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\\n* Preventing demineralization of teeth\\n* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\\nAs a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\\nFluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water.'}],\n",

According to the available information, fluoride combats tooth decay through three primary mechanisms: blocking acid formation by bacteria, preventing demineralization of teeth, and enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel [ns_382].\\n\\nFirstly, fluoride inhibits the formation of acid by bacteria, which is a key step in the development of tooth decay. By blocking this process, fluoride reduces the likelihood of acid erosion and subsequent tooth decay. This mechanism is particularly important, as it targets the root cause of tooth decay and prevents the progression of the disease.\\n\\nSecondly, fluoride prevents demineralization of teeth by making them more resistant to acid attacks. This is achieved by increasing the tooth's ability to remineralize, or rebuild, its enamel structure. By strengthening the tooth's enamel, fluoride creates a barrier against acid erosion, making it more difficult for bacteria to penetrate and cause decay.\\n\\nLastly, fluoride enhances remineralization of destroyed enamel, which is a critical step in reversing tooth decay. By promoting the remineralization process, fluoride helps to repair and restore damaged enamel, reducing the risk of further decay and promoting overall oral health.\\n\\nIn summary, fluoride's three mechanisms of action – blocking acid formation, preventing demineralization, and enhancing remineralization – make it an effective agent in combating tooth decay and promoting oral health.\",\n",

It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\\nIt is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body’s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\\nIn addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g/kg/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g/kg/day for muscle synthesis.3\\nAlthough athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements.

Most nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, but some urea is also contained in feces. Nitrogen is also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to balance the amount of protein used by the body, measured as the amount of nitrogen lost from the body. The Institute Of Medicine used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein.\\n* Nitrogen Balance– A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen consumed equals the amount of nitrogen excreted. Most healthy adults are in nitrogen balance. If more protein is consumed than needed, this extra protein is used for energy, and the nitrogen waste that results is excreted. The lowest amount of protein a person can consume and still remain in nitrogen balance represents that person’s minimum protein requirement.\\nFigure 6.14.

Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.\\nFigure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.\\nOnce inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.\\nChylomicrons are one type of lipoprotein—transport vehicles for lipids in blood and lymph.

       "    'passage': 'Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Most of the body’s calcium—more than 99% of it—is stored in bone, where it’s important for bone strength and structure. The remaining 1% of the body’s calcium is found in the blood and soft tissues, but it is here that calcium performs its most critical functions. For example, calcium is required for the transmission of every nerve impulse, electrical signals sent from one nerve cell to another. It’s also required for every cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. With inadequate calcium, muscles can’t relax, and instead become stiff and contract involuntarily, a condition known as tetany. Calcium also plays vital roles in blood pressure regulation, blood clotting, enzyme activation, hormone secretion, and signaling between cells.1\\nThe many roles of calcium around the body are critical to daily survival, so maintaining homeostasis, or a steady state, of blood calcium levels is a high priority. The body rigorously controls blood calcium levels in a very tight range. If blood calcium drops, your body initiates several mechanisms to restore homeostasis, including drawing calcium from the bone. While the calcium stored in bone is important for long-term strength and structure of bone, it also serves as a calcium reserve that can be drawn upon to support the vital functions of calcium in the body, should blood calcium drop too low.\\nTwo endocrine glands are key players in the regulation of blood calcium concentrations: the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It secretes a hormone called calcitonin. There are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea and located at the back of the thyroid gland. They secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).\\nFigure 9.4. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located at the back of the neck.\\nLet’s take a closer look at how the body regulates blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium concentration drops too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH then acts in several ways to increase blood calcium levels:\\n1. PTH stimulates the activity of osteoclasts to release calcium from bone.\\n2. PTH acts on the kidney to reduce the amount of calcium lost in the urine, returning more to circulation.\\n3. PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that convert vitamin D to its active form, also called calcitriol. Activated vitamin D acts on the intestine to increase the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D also works together with PTH to stimulate release of calcium from the bone and reduce calcium loss in urine.\\nOnce blood calcium levels are normal, PTH levels drop, turning off all of these mechanisms of increasing calcium.\\nOn the other hand, if blood calcium levels become too high, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits the release of calcium from the bone and increases calcium excretion from the kidneys. These mechanisms help to restore normal blood calcium concentrations, after which calcitonin levels drop again.\\nFigure 9.5. Blood calcium (Ca2+) levels are tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin.\\nThrough these two opposing pathways—PTH and vitamin D for raising blood calcium and calcitonin for lowering blood calcium—the body can very effectively maintain blood calcium homeostasis. This system is dependent upon stored calcium in bone, which is sacrificed when needed to ensure adequate blood calcium. In the short-term, this isn’t a problem, because bone remodeling allows you to replace calcium in the bone. However, in the long-term, inadequate dietary calcium means you continuously draw down the calcium stores in your bones, resulting in declining bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture.\\nCalcium requirements are highest for children and adolescents, who are growing and building bones, and for older adults, who are losing bone density.'}],\n",

Other health organizations offer more flexible advice, recommending that solid foods be introduced sometime between 4 and 6 months, depending on the baby’s development, interest in eating solids, and family preferences. Regardless, most babies aren’t ready to eat solid foods before 4 months, and starting too soon may increase the risk of obesity. Yet it’s also important not to start solids too late, as beyond 6 months, breast milk alone can’t support a baby’s nutrient requirements.1\\nHowever, as babies begin to eat solids, breast milk or formula continue to be the nutritional foundation of the diet. This period is also called complementary feeding, because solid foods are meant to complement the nutrients provided by breast milk or formula. Between 6 and 12 months, babies gradually eat more solid foods and less milk so that by 12 months, formula is no longer needed. Breastfeeding mothers may choose to wean at 12 months or continue breastfeeding as long as she and the baby like.\\nBabies should be developmentally ready to eat solids before trying their first foods. A baby ready for solids should be able to do the following:1\\n* Sit up without support (e.g., in a high chair or lap)\\n* Open mouth for a spoonful of food and swallow it without gagging or pushing it back out\\n* Reach for and grasp food or toys and bring them to his or her mouth\\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends beginning with iron-rich foods such as pureed meat or iron-fortified cereal (e.g., rice cereal, oatmeal), as iron is usually the most limiting nutrient at this age, particularly for exclusively breastfed babies. Once these foods are introduced, others can gradually be added to the diet, introducing one at a time to keep an eye out for allergic reactions. Work up to a variety of foods from all of the food groups, as babies are willing to try just about anything at this stage, and this is an opportunity for them to learn about different flavors. You can also gradually increase texture, from pureed to mashed food, then lumpy foods to soft finger foods. By 12 months, most babies can eat most of the foods at the family table, with some modifications to avoid choking hazards.1,2\\nWhen choosing good complementary foods, there are three main goals: (1) to meet nutrient requirements; (2) to introduce potentially allergenic foods; and (3) to support your baby in learning to eat many different flavors and textures. Parents should be sure to include the following:1,2\\n* Good sources of iron and zinc, as both minerals can be limiting for breastfed infants. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified cereal. Beans, whole grains, and green vegetables add smaller amounts of iron.\\n* Adequate fat to support babies’ rapid growth and brain development. Good sources include whole fat yogurt, avocado, nut butters, and olive oil for cooking vegetables. Fish is also a great food for babies, because it provides both iron and fat, and it’s a good source of omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, which support brain development.\\n* A variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, so that your baby learns to like many different tastes and textures. It may take babies and toddlers 8 to 10 exposures of a new food before they learn to like it, so don’t be discouraged if your baby doesn’t like some foods right away.\\nThere is no need to avoid giving your baby common food allergens, such as peanut, egg, dairy, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, or tree nuts.

Intestinal cells form the barrier between the interior of the body and the lumen, or tube, of the GI tract, which is technically outside of the body and teeming with potential pathogens. Immune tissue in the GI tract and other parts of the body produce immune cells that target foreign invaders, in part through the production of antibodies, protective proteins that bind to foreign substances. However, this function requires the immune system to accurately distinguish between normal food proteins and invading pathogens. A food allergy\\xa0is what happens if the immune system mistakenly identifies a food protein as an invasive threat.\\nThe most common type of food allergy involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to a specific substance, orallergen. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur immediately after consuming the food (i.e., within seconds to minutes), although reactions can sometimes be delayed by two hours or more. Because an allergic reaction is caused by the immune system, it can lead to symptoms all over the body, including skin rashes; swollen lips, face, or throat; wheezing and difficulty breathing; nausea and vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; and rarely, a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction involving more than one organ system—a rash coupled with difficulty breathing, for example—is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately with epinephrine, commonly administered by injection with a device such as an EpiPen, and then person should seek immediate medical attention.1\\nFigure 3.19. Common food allergens: peanuts, dairy, wheat, eggs, and shrimp. At right, an EpiPen, containing injectable epinephrine, is pictured. \\nThe most common food allergies in the U.S. are caused by proteins in peanuts, tree nuts, milk, shellfish, eggs, fish, wheat, soy and sesame.4,5 A 2019 study reported that 19% of adults in the U.S. believe they’re allergic to at least one food. After asking people about their symptoms, the researchers estimated that the true incidence of food allergies is closer to 11%, while the remaining 8% of people likely have a food intolerance.4\\nFood allergies are common in children, affecting about 8% of U.S. children, although allergies can also develop later in life.5 It’s common for young children to outgrow allergies to egg, dairy, wheat, or soy, but peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are often lifelong. Recent research has found that letting babies eat common food allergens, particularly peanut products, can prevent the development of allergies, perhaps by allowing the immune system an early opportunity to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens.6\\nIf you think you may have a food allergy, it’s important to see an allergist to ensure you have an accurate diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed based on symptoms after consuming a food, specific IgE blood tests, and/or skin prick tests, where a tiny amount of food protein is scratched onto the skin to test for a reaction. Blood and skin tests determine whether a person is sensitized to an allergen, meaning that they’re producing IgE antibodies to the food. However, the presence of IgE antibodies doesn’t definitively mean a person has a food allergy; it’s common to have a positive IgE test but still be able to eat the food without symptoms. The gold standard test for diagnosing is an oral food challenge—consuming a small amount of the food and watching for signs of a reaction—although due to time, cost, and risk, these are not always conducted. If you are diagnosed with a food allergy, you will be counseled to strictly avoid the food and carry injectable epinephrine in case of accidental consumption.'}]}]"

According to the available information, fluoride combats tooth decay through three primary mechanisms: blocking acid formation by bacteria, preventing demineralization of teeth, and enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel [ns_382].\\n\\nFirstly, fluoride inhibits the formation of acid by bacteria, which is a key step in the development of tooth decay. By blocking this process, fluoride reduces the likelihood of acid erosion and subsequent tooth decay. This mechanism is particularly important, as it targets the root cause of tooth decay and prevents the progression of the disease.\\n\\nSecondly, fluoride prevents demineralization of teeth by making them more resistant to acid attacks. This is achieved by increasing the tooth's ability to remineralize, or rebuild, its enamel structure. By strengthening the tooth's enamel, fluoride creates a barrier against acid erosion, making it more difficult for bacteria to penetrate and cause decay.\\n\\nLastly, fluoride enhances remineralization of destroyed enamel, which is a critical step in reversing tooth decay. By promoting the remineralization process, fluoride helps to repair and restore damaged enamel, reducing the risk of further decay and promoting overall oral health.\\n\\nIn summary, fluoride's three mechanisms of action \\u2013 blocking acid formation, preventing demineralization, and enhancing remineralization \\u2013 make it an effective agent in combating tooth decay and promoting oral health.\",\n",

Leptin plays a crucial role in signaling the body's energy status, and its mechanism of action is intricately linked to its production and reception in the brain.\\n\\nWhen fat stores increase, leptin is produced in response, serving as a signal to the brain that the body is in a state of positive energy balance [ns_232]. This hormone then communicates with the satiety center in the hypothalamus, conveying the message that the body's energy needs are being met. As a result, leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure, thereby regulating appetite and maintaining a healthy energy balance.\",\n",
      "    \"Fluoride is a well-known agent in preventing tooth decay, and its mechanisms of action are crucial in understanding its effectiveness. According to the available information, fluoride combats tooth decay through three primary mechanisms: blocking acid formation by bacteria, preventing demineralization of teeth, and enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel [ns_382].\\n\\nFirstly, fluoride inhibits the formation of acid by bacteria, which is a key step in the development of tooth decay. By blocking this process, fluoride reduces the likelihood of acid erosion and subsequent tooth decay. This mechanism is particularly important, as it targets the root cause of tooth decay and prevents the progression of the disease.\\n\\nSecondly, fluoride prevents demineralization of teeth by making them more resistant to acid attacks. This is achieved by increasing the tooth's ability to remineralize, or rebuild, its enamel structure. By strengthening the tooth's enamel, fluoride creates a barrier against acid erosion, making it more difficult for bacteria to penetrate and cause decay.\\n\\nLastly, fluoride enhances remineralization of destroyed enamel, which is a critical step in reversing tooth decay. By promoting the remineralization process, fluoride helps to repair and restore damaged enamel, reducing the risk of further decay and promoting overall oral health.\\n\\nIn summary, fluoride's three mechanisms of action \\u2013 blocking acid formation, preventing demineralization, and enhancing remineralization \\u2013 make it an effective agent in combating tooth decay and promoting oral health.\",\n",
      "    \"The recommended daily intake of protein for athletes is 1.2-2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which is higher than the RDA of 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day for sedentary adults [ns_193, ns_444]. This increased protein intake is necessary to support the higher energy demands and muscle protein synthesis required for athletic activities.\\n\\nIn comparison to sedentary adults, athletes require a higher protein intake to maintain and repair their muscles, which are subjected to increased stress and damage during exercise [ns_444]. The recommended daily intake of protein for athletes is 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day, which is higher than the recommended daily intake for sedentary adults, which is 0.8 g/kg/day [ns_444]. This increased protein intake helps to promote muscle recovery and growth, which is essential for athletes to perform at their best.\\n\\nIn summary, the recommended daily intake of protein for athletes is 1.2-2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which is higher than the RDA of 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day for sedentary adults [ns_193, ns_444].

      "    \"The difference between monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) lies in the number of double bonds between the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chain. Specifically, MUFAs have one double bond [ns_134], whereas PUFAs have two or more double bonds [ns_134]. This difference in unsaturation affects the physical and chemical properties of these fatty acids, influencing their roles in human health.\\n\\nIn terms of food sources, MUFAs are found in plant-based sources such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and plant oils [ns_136], while PUFAs are found in plant oils, fish, flaxseed, and some nuts [ns_136]. Both types of fatty acids are associated with lower LDL cholesterol levels and a lower risk of heart disease [ns_136].\\n\\nPUFAs, in particular, have been linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and CVD-related deaths due to their ability to lower blood levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol [ns_164]. MUFAs, found in plant sources like olive oil and nuts, may also be associated with a reduced risk of CVD [ns_164]. However, it's essential to note that replacing saturated fats with refined carbohydrates may increase the risk of heart disease, highlighting the importance of choosing healthy fats and whole foods.\\n\\nIn summary, the primary difference between MUFAs and PUFAs is the number of double bonds in their carbon chain, with MUFAs having one double bond and PUFAs having two or more. Both types of fatty acids have distinct food sources and are associated with various health benefits, including lower LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.\",\n",
      "    \"Emulsification is a crucial process in lipid digestion that involves breaking down large fat globules into smaller droplets, making lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes. This process is facilitated by bile salts, which have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic sides, allowing them to interact with both the fat globules and the watery environment of the digestive tract [ns_146]. As a result, emulsification increases the surface area for enzymes to act, enabling pancreatic lipases to enzymatically digest triglycerides into fatty acids, monoglycerides, and free glycerol.\\n\\nMoreover, emulsification plays a vital role in facilitating the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form micelles, allowing fats to get close to intestinal cells for absorption [ns_147]. This process enables the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream, which are then transported to cells around the body.\\n\\nIn addition, emulsification is essential for the digestion of lipids in the watery environment of the digestive tract. By breaking down large droplets of triglycerides into smaller droplets, emulsification allows for enzymatic digestion using lipases [ns_143]. This ultimately facilitates the absorption of lipids into circulation and their transportation around the body.\\n\\nIn conclusion, emulsification is a critical process in lipid digestion that enables the breakdown of large fat globules into smaller droplets, making lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes. It also facilitates the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins into the bloodstream and the digestion of lipids in the watery environment of the digestive tract.\",\n",
      "    \"The regulation of blood calcium levels is a crucial process in the human body, and it is achieved through the coordinated effort of two hormones: Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Calcitonin. These hormones play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of calcium levels in the blood, and their production is regulated by the endocrine system.\\n\\nPTH is produced by the Parathyroid glands [ns_369], which are located in the neck. This hormone plays a crucial role in increasing calcium levels in the blood by stimulating the release of calcium from bones and increasing calcium absorption in the intestines.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Calcitonin is produced by the Thyroid gland [ns_369]. This hormone has the opposite effect of PTH, as it helps to decrease calcium levels in the blood by reducing calcium absorption in the intestines and increasing calcium excretion in the urine.\\n\\nIn summary, the two hormones involved in blood calcium regulation are PTH and Calcitonin, with PTH being produced by the Parathyroid glands and Calcitonin being produced by the Thyroid gland.\",\n",
      "    \"Introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies during their first year of life is crucial for several reasons. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends introducing iron-rich foods first, followed by other foods, including potentially allergenic ones, one at a time to monitor for allergic reactions [ns_477]. This approach allows parents to identify any potential allergic reactions early on and take necessary precautions.\\n\\nMoreover, introducing potentially allergenic foods during this period can significantly reduce the risk of developing food allergies. For instance, introducing peanut products between 4-11 months has been shown to reduce peanut allergy by 81% [ns_478]. Similarly, early introduction of egg can protect children from developing an egg allergy. This is because the immune system is still developing and is more likely to learn to tolerate common allergens if exposed to them early on, reducing the risk of lifelong allergies [ns_38].\\n\\nBy introducing these foods early on, parents can help their babies' immune system learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens, making it less likely for allergies to develop. This approach can provide long-term benefits, as it can help prevent the development of lifelong allergies. Overall, introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies during their first year of life is an important step in promoting a healthy and robust immune system.\"\n",

      "['The muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach is called the esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that uses peristalsis, a wave-like motion, to propel food into the stomach.\\n\\nAs for chemical digestion, some limited chemical digestion does occur in the esophagus, but it is not a significant site of digestion. The enzymes present in the saliva, such as amylase and lipase, continue to break down carbohydrates and fats during the passage of food through the esophagus. However, the main site of chemical digestion occurs in the mouth, where saliva enzymes break down food into smaller molecules, and in the small intestine, where pancreatic enzymes and intestinal enzymes further break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\\n\\nThe stomach, which receives the food from the esophagus, is a major site of mechanical digestion, where food is mixed with stomach acid and digestive enzymes to break down proteins and fats into smaller molecules.', 'The two main types of starch are amylose and amylopectin.\\n\\nAmylose is a linear polymer of glucose molecules, consisting of a long chain of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. It is a helical structure with a repeating pattern of six glucose molecules. Amylose is relatively insoluble in water and is often referred to as \"linear starch\".\\n\\nAmylopectin, on the other hand, is a branched polymer of glucose molecules, consisting of a mixture of α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds. It has a more complex structure, with shorter chains of α-1,4-linked glucose molecules (called \"branch points\") attached to the main chain through α-1,6-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin is more soluble in water than amylose and is often referred to as \"branched starch\".\\n\\nThe main differences between amylose and amylopectin are:\\n\\n* Structure: Amylose is a linear polymer, while amylopectin is a branched polymer.\\n* Solubility: Amylose is relatively insoluble in water, while amylopectin is more soluble.\\n* Function: Amylose provides structure and rigidity to the starch granule, while amylopectin provides storage capacity and helps to absorb and release water.\\n\\nThe ratio of amylose to amylopectin can vary depending on the plant species and the type of starch. For example, potato starch is predominantly amylopectin, while cornstarch is predominantly amylose. The combination of amylose and amylopectin in starch determines its properties, such as gelatinization temperature, viscosity, and retrogradation.', \"The hormone secreted by adipose tissue that helps regulate appetite is called leptin. Leptin is produced by adipose tissue (fat cells) and is released into the bloodstream in proportion to the amount of body fat.\\n\\nLeptin works by sending signals to the brain about the body's energy stores. When leptin levels are high, it binds to receptors in the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus, which is responsible for regulating appetite and metabolism. This binding causes the brain to:\\n\\n1. Suppress appetite: Leptin signals the brain to reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, making it less likely to overeat.\\n2. Increase metabolism: Leptin also stimulates the brain to increase thermogenesis (heat production) and energy expenditure, which helps to burn off excess calories.\\n\\nIn normal-weight individuals, leptin levels are typically high, and this helps to maintain a healthy appetite and metabolism. However, in individuals with obesity, leptin resistance can occur, which means that the brain becomes less responsive to leptin's signals. This can lead to overeating and weight gain.\\n\\nAdditionally, some research suggests that leptin may also play a role in regulating other physiological processes, such as:\\n\\n* Insulin sensitivity: Leptin can improve insulin sensitivity, which helps to regulate blood sugar levels.\\n* Inflammation: Leptin has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help to reduce inflammation in the body.\\n* Cardiovascular health: Leptin may also play a role in regulating cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\\n\\nOverall, leptin plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and metabolism, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes.\", 'Fluoride is a well-known agent that helps combat tooth decay by using three primary mechanisms:\\n\\n1. **Fluoride Inhibition of Enzymes**: Fluoride can inhibit the enzyme amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars. By reducing the activity of amylase, fluoride slows down the production of acid in the mouth, which in turn reduces the risk of tooth decay.\\n2. **Fluoride Reversal of Early Lesions**: Fluoride can reverse early stages of tooth decay by remineralizing the tooth enamel and reducing the progression of the lesion. When fluoride is present in the mouth, it can bind to the tooth enamel and form a layer of fluorapatite, which is more resistant to acid attacks than regular enamel. This helps to reverse early stages of tooth decay and prevent further progression.\\n3. **Fluoride Antimicrobial Activity**: Fluoride also has antimicrobial properties, which help to reduce the growth of bacteria that contribute to tooth decay. Fluoride can inhibit the growth of bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans, which is a primary cause of tooth decay. By reducing the growth of these bacteria, fluoride helps to prevent the formation of acid and the progression of tooth decay.\\n\\nThese three mechanisms work together to help prevent tooth decay and promote oral health. Regular use of fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash, or other fluoride products can help to maintain a healthy mouth and reduce the risk of tooth decay.', \"The recommended daily intake of protein for athletes varies depending on factors such as sport, intensity, and body composition. However, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommends that endurance athletes consume 1.2-1.4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, while strength-training athletes should aim for 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\\n\\nFor example, a 70 kg (154 lbs) endurance athlete would need around 84-98 grams of protein per day, while a 70 kg strength-training athlete would need around 112-154 grams of protein per day.\\n\\nIn comparison, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for sedentary adults is around 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. This means that a 70 kg sedentary adult would need around 56 grams of protein per day.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that these are general guidelines, and individual protein needs may vary depending on factors such as age, sex, and overall health. Additionally, some athletes may require more protein than others due to factors such as increased muscle mass, high-intensity training, or specific dietary restrictions.\\n\\nHere's a rough breakdown of the protein intake recommendations for different groups:\\n\\n* Sedentary adults (RDA): 0.8 grams/kg/day\\n* Endurance athletes (ISSN): 1.2-1.4 grams/kg/day\\n* Strength-training athletes (ISSN): 1.6-2.2 grams/kg/day\\n* Power athletes (e.g. weightlifters, sprinters): 2.0-3.0 grams/kg/day\\n* Bodybuilders: 2.5-3.5 grams/kg/day\\n\\nKeep in mind that these are general guidelines, and individual protein needs may vary. It's always a good idea to consult with a sports dietitian or healthcare professional to determine the best protein intake for your specific needs and goals.\", 'The enzyme produced in the mouth that begins the chemical breakdown of triglycerides is lingual lipase. Lingual lipase is a lipase enzyme that is produced in the tongue and is responsible for breaking down triglycerides in food into fatty acids and glycerol.', 'Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are both types of unsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for various bodily functions. The main difference between them lies in the number of double bonds they contain in their molecular structure.\\n\\nMonounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFAs):\\n\\n* Have one double bond in their molecular structure\\n* Typically have a saturated fatty acid chain with one unsaturated bond\\n* Examples: oleic acid (found in olive oil), palmitoleic acid (found in palm oil)\\n* Generally considered healthy and beneficial for heart health\\n* Can help lower total cholesterol and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels\\n* May help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity\\n\\nPolyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs):\\n\\n* Have multiple double bonds in their molecular structure (typically 2-6 double bonds)\\n* Typically have a saturated fatty acid chain with multiple unsaturated bonds\\n* Examples: omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA, found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts), omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid, found in vegetable oils and nuts)\\n* Also considered essential for heart health and brain function\\n* Can help reduce inflammation and improve blood lipid profiles\\n* May help alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions\\n\\nIn summary, MUFAs have one double bond, while PUFAs have multiple double bonds. Both types of fatty acids are important for overall health, but PUFAs are particularly beneficial for brain function and may have a stronger impact on heart health. A balanced diet that includes both MUFAs and PUFAs can provide a range of health benefits.', \"Emulsification is the process by which two or more liquids that don't normally mix, such as oil and water, combine into a stable mixture. In the context of lipid digestion, emulsification is crucial for breaking down dietary fats into smaller particles that can be absorbed by the body.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the emulsification process during lipid digestion:\\n\\n1. Food intake: When you eat, you consume a variety of foods that contain fats, such as triglycerides. These triglycerides are made up of glycerol and three fatty acid chains.\\n2. Gastric digestion: In the stomach, the food is mixed with gastric juices that contain enzymes like gastric amylase and gastric lipase. The gastric lipase breaks down the triglycerides into smaller molecules, such as diglycerides and fatty acids.\\n3. Emulsification: The diglycerides and fatty acids are then mixed with bile salts produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile salts are amphipathic molecules, meaning they have both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-fearing) regions. This unique structure allows bile salts to bind to the hydrophobic fatty acids and diglycerides, creating an emulsion.\\n4. Formation of micelles: The bile salts and fatty acids combine to form micelles, which are small, spherical structures with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface. The micelles are able to solubilize the fatty acids and diglycerides, allowing them to be transported in the aqueous environment of the digestive tract.\\n5. Pancreatic digestion: Once the emulsion reaches the small intestine, it is mixed with pancreatic juices that contain enzymes like lipase. The lipase breaks down the micelles into even smaller particles, such as monoglycerides and fatty acids.\\n6. Absorption: The monoglycerides and fatty acids are then absorbed into the enterocytes, the cells lining the small intestine. The fatty acids are transported into the bloodstream and carried to the liver for processing, while the monoglycerides are re-esterified with fatty acids to form triglycerides, which are then packaged into chylomicrons and transported to the liver for storage or processing.\\n\\nEmulsification is important for lipid digestion because it allows the body to break down dietary fats into smaller particles that can be absorbed and utilized. Without emulsification, the fatty acids and diglycerides would remain in their original form, making it difficult for the body to absorb them. Emulsification also helps to increase the surface area of the fatty acids and diglycerides, making it easier for the enzymes to break them down.\\n\\nIn summary, emulsification is a critical step in the digestion of dietary fats, allowing the body to break down triglycerides into smaller particles that can be absorbed and utilized. The process involves the formation of micelles, which are small, spherical structures that solubilize the fatty acids and diglycerides, allowing them to be transported in the aqueous environment of the digestive tract.\", 'The two hormones involved in blood calcium regulation are:\\n\\n1. Parathyroid hormone (PTH): Produced by the parathyroid glands, which are four small glands located in the neck, adjacent to the thyroid gland.\\n2. Calcitonin: Produced by the thyroid gland, specifically by the parafollicular C cells.\\n\\nPTH helps to increase blood calcium levels by stimulating the release of calcium from bones and increasing calcium absorption in the intestines. Calcitonin, on the other hand, helps to decrease blood calcium levels by inhibiting the release of calcium from bones and reducing calcium absorption in the intestines. The balance between these two hormones helps to maintain normal blood calcium levels.', \"Introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies during their first year of life is important for several reasons:\\n\\n1. Reduced risk of allergy: Introducing these foods early can help reduce the risk of developing allergies later in life. Research suggests that introducing allergenic foods in small amounts and frequently during the first year can help the immune system learn to tolerate them.\\n2. Tolerance induction: By introducing these foods early, babies can develop tolerance to them, which means their immune system learns to recognize them as harmless and doesn't overreact to them. This can reduce the risk of an allergic reaction.\\n3. Improved gut health: Introducing a diverse range of foods, including potentially allergenic ones, can help promote a healthy gut microbiome. This can lead to improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and a stronger immune system.\\n4. Reduced risk of atopic march: The atopic march refers to the progression of allergies from one type to another. Introducing potentially allergenic foods early can help reduce the risk of this progression.\\n5. Easier introduction: Introducing these foods early makes it easier to introduce them later in life. If you wait too long, babies may be more resistant to new foods, making it more challenging to introduce them.\\n6. Better nutritional profile: Potentially allergenic foods, such as peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and eggs, are rich in essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and vitamins. Introducing these foods early can help ensure babies get a balanced diet.\\n7. Reduced risk of food aversion: Introducing potentially allergenic foods early can help babies develop a more accepting palate, reducing the risk of food aversion later in life.\\n\\nSome key guidelines to keep in mind when introducing potentially allergenic foods to babies:\\n\\n* Start with small amounts (1-2 teaspoons) and gradually increase the amount as the baby becomes accustomed to the food.\\n* Introduce one new food at a time to monitor for any signs of an allergic reaction.\\n* Choose hypoallergenic formulas or breast milk as the primary source of nutrition until the baby is at least 6 months old.\\n* Consult with a pediatrician or healthcare provider before introducing any new foods, especially if the baby has a family history of allergies.\\n\\nRemember, every baby is different, and it's essential to monitor for any signs of an allergic reaction or intolerance when introducing new foods. If you're unsure or have concerns, consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.\"]\n"
