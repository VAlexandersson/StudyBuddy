      "summarized_document": "The hormone secreted by adipose tissue that helps regulate appetite is leptin. Leptin is produced as fat stores increase and communicates to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance, suppressing hunger and increasing energy expenditure. Higher levels of leptin act on the brain to reduce hunger and increase energy expenditure, helping to regulate appetite and energy balance."
