      "full_document": "Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.\nIn dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.\nVitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations\u2014chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person\u2019s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\nRecall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we\u2019ll discuss later on this page.\nFigure 9.11. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin (vitamin D3) or provided in the diet (vitamin D2 or D3). It is converted by reactions occurring first in the liver (making calcidiol) and then kidney (making calcitriol, the active form). Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.\nBeyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1",

      "full_document": "In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, a disease in which the bones are soft, weak, and deformed. Rickets was very common in the U.S. until the 1930s, when milk processors were asked to add vitamin D to cow\u2019s milk. Milk fortification has virtually eliminated rickets from the U.S. and other developed countries. However, rickets does still occur in breastfed infants and children raised on vegan diets who aren\u2019t provided with other sources of vitamin D, particularly if they have darker skin pigmentation.1,3\nFigure 9.13. Vitamin D deficiency in children causes rickets, a disease in which inadequate vitamin D leads to soft, weak, and deformed bones.\nIn adults, vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia, characterized by softening of bones, reduced bone mineral density, and increased risk of osteoporosis. Because bones are continuously remodelled throughout the lifespan, inadequate vitamin D limits the calcium available to continue to rebuild bone tissue. Vitamin D deficiency can also cause bone pain, as well as muscle weakness and pain, symptoms that can increase the risk of falling and fractures, particularly in older adults.2\nAlthough vitamin D toxicity is rare, taking excessive amounts of vitamin D in supplement form can lead to hypercalcemia, or high blood calcium. Hypercalcemia can cause kidney damage and calcium deposits to develop in soft tissues such as the kidneys, blood vessels, or other parts of the cardiovascular system. Synthesis of vitamin D from the sun does not cause vitamin D toxicity, because vitamin D synthesis is tightly regulated and decreases if the body has abundant vitamin D.",

      "full_document": "The best activities for stimulating new bone are weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, hiking, and dancing, and resistance exercises like weight lifting.\n* Nutrition- Ensuring adequate nutrition is a key component in maintaining bone health. Having low dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D are strong risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Protein is also important during childhood and adolescence for proper bone development, and in older age to preserve bone mass.4\n* Smoking- Smoking cigarettes has long been known to correlate to a decrease in bone mass and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, because people who smoke are more likely to be physically inactive and have poor diets, it is difficult to determine whether smoking itself causes osteoporosis. Smoking is also linked to earlier menopause, and therefore the increased risk of developing osteoporosis among female smokers may also be attributed, at least in part, to having reduced estrogen production at an earlier age. However, studies have also shown that tobacco smoke and nicotine can directly impact bone metabolism.5\n* Alcohol intake- Alcohol intake may also affect bone health, although this seems to depend on the amount consumed. Light to moderate alcohol intake (two drinks or less per day) has been shown in some studies to be associated with an increase in bone density and a decreased risk of developing osteoporosis. However, excessive alcohol intake is associated with decreased bone density and increased fracture risk, although this may be due in part to other lifestyle factors, such as poor diet and less physical activity.6\n* Being underweight- Being underweight significantly increases the risk of developing osteoporosis, because people who are underweight often have a smaller frame size and a lower peak bone mass. The most striking relationship between being underweight and bone health is seen in people with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is strongly correlated with low peak bone mass, and more than 50 percent of men and women who have this illness develop osteoporosis, often very early in life.\nThe changeable risk factors for osteoporosis provide ways for people to improve their bone health, even though some people may be genetically predisposed to the disease. Prevention of osteoporosis begins early in life since this is a critical time of bone growth. Eating a balanced diet that provides adequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and protein is important for bone health throughout the life cycle. Participating in exercise such as walking, hiking, and weight lifting, and refraining from risky behaviors like smoking and excessive drinking are all behaviors that will help protect bones..",

      "full_document": "Osteoporosis\u00a0is a bone disease that occurs when bone density or bone mass decreases. The bone becomes thinner and more porous and is therefore more susceptible to breaking. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, more than 53 million people in the U.S. either have osteoporosis already or are at high risk of developing it due to low bone mass.1\nFigure 9.2. Osteoporosis. This illustration shows the difference between the structure of normal bone, which is less porous, and bone with osteoporosis, which is more porous. The two circles located on the spine and hip represent the location of the images.\nBone loss usually occurs without symptoms, so osteoporosis is often called a silent disease. It can go undetected until bones become so weak that they fracture due to a sudden strain, bump, or fall.\nOne way bone health can be assessed is by measuring bone mineral density. A bone mineral density (BMD) test can detect osteoporosis and predict the risk of bone fracture. The most common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. This method can measure bone density over the entire body, but most often the DXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of overall bone strength and health. DXA is painless, non-invasive, uses low doses of radiation, and is the most accurate way to measure BMD.\nAn individual\u2019s chances of developing osteoporosis depend on several risk factors, some of which are controllable and some of which are not. It is thought that genetic factors (such as sex and race) may account for up to 75 percent of bone mass, and lifestyle factors (such as diet and exercise habits) account for the remaining 25 percent.2\nOsteoporosis risk factors that are biological and can\u2019t be controlled:\n* Body frame size- People with small frames are at higher risk for osteoporosis.\n* Race- Caucasian and Asian populations are at higher risk of osteoporosis compared to African American and Hispanic populations, which are at lower risk.1\n* Family history\u2013 Having a family member with osteoporosis may increase risk, as heredity seems to play a part in the development of osteoporosis.\n* Age- After age 40, bone mass declines due to bone breakdown exceeding bone formation. Therefore, any person over the age of 40 has an increased likelihood of developing osteoporosis compared with a younger person. Starting out with a higher peak bone mass in early adulthood enables you to lose more bone during the aging process and not develop osteoporosis.\n* Sex- Females, on average, have a lower peak bone mass compared with males (see Figure 9.3) and a much greater risk of developing osteoporosis, in part because of hormone levels.\n* Hormones- The female hormone estrogen and the male hormone testosterone both help to increase peak bone mass. Estrogen is the primary female reproductive hormone, and it stimulates bone building and reduces bone breakdown. When women go through menopause (usually around age 50), they experience a natural decline in estrogen levels, which accelerates bone loss and increases the risk of developing osteoporosis (Figure 9.3).\nFigure 9.3. Age and bone mass. Bone density peaks at about 30 years of age, and women lose bone mass more rapidly than men, particularly around menopause.\nRisk factors that can be controlled:\n* Physical inactivity- Physical inactivity lowers peak bone mass, decreases BMD at all ages, and is linked to an increase in fracture risk, especially in the elderly. Regular exercise can help individuals achieve greater peak bone mass, prevents bone loss for women and men age 30 and older, and maintains strength and balance to help prevent falls later in life.",
      "summarized_document": "A deficiency in vitamin D can negatively affect bone health by increasing the risk of osteoporosis, which can lead to bone loss and fractures. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in maintaining peak bone mass, and a deficiency can accelerate bone loss, especially in women after menopause. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help achieve greater peak bone mass and prevent bone loss, but a deficiency in vitamin D can negate these benefits."

      "full_document": "In most people, vitamin D synthesis in the skin provides a significant portion of their body\u2019s needs, and a little sun exposure can go a long way. Vitamin D researchers suggest that most people need between 5 and 30 minutes of sun exposure between 10 AM and 3 PM, at least twice per week, in order to synthesize adequate vitamin D. However, any factor that decreases exposure to UV rays can interfere with vitamin D synthesis, including the following:2\n* Geographic latitude and season. Your location on Earth and the time of the year affects your exposure to UV radiation from the sun. Exposure to UV light is greatest at the equator and declines as you move further north or south. Likewise, in the summer months, the sun is directly overhead for a greater part of the day, so you have more opportunities to synthesize vitamin D. In the winter, the sun stays lower in the sky, day length is shorter, and cloud cover is more likely to block the sun\u2019s rays, all of which decrease opportunities to synthesize vitamin D. North of about 35 degrees latitude, vitamin D synthesis is inadequate for at least a few months during the winter, because the sun simply doesn\u2019t get high enough in the sky to provide enough UV radiation on earth\u2019s surface. For example, in Boston and at the California-Oregon border (42nd parallel north), vitamin D synthesis occurs only from March until October. However, in Los Angeles (34th parallel north), vitamin D synthesis occurs year round. Ozone and air pollution can also block UV rays and decrease vitamin D synthesis.\n* Skin pigmentation. Darker skin pigmentation, caused by greater melanin production in the skin, decreases UV light absorption. This helps to protect the skin from damage from UV radiation\u2014a helpful adaptation for those living closer to the equator\u2014but it also reduces synthesis of vitamin D. People with darker skin pigmentation need to spend more time in the sun in order to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D as lighter-skinned people.\n* Age. The efficiency of vitamin D synthesis declines with age. In addition, older adults often spend less time outside so may receive less exposure to sunlight.\n* Sun-protective behavior. While some UV light exposure is needed to synthesize vitamin D, UV radiation is also carcinogenic, and too much exposure increases the risk of skin cancer. It\u2019s wise to protect your skin from UV radiation by applying sunscreen, covering up with clothing and a hat, finding shade, and avoiding sun exposure in the middle of the day. People who are highly vigilant in these sun-protective behaviors or simply aren\u2019t able to go outside during the day (UV rays don\u2019t penetrate glass) may not get enough UV light for vitamin D synthesis.\nWith so many factors affecting UV radiation exposure, many people are unable to synthesize enough vitamin D for at least part of the year. Because vitamin D is fat-soluble, liver and adipose storage can supply the body for a while. Beyond that, dietary sources and supplements may be needed to meet the vitamin D requirement.2",

      "full_document": "The recommended intake levels of several micronutrients are increased in older adulthood, while others are decreased. A few nutrient changes to note include the following:\n* To slow bone loss, the recommendations for calcium increase from 1,000 milligrams per day to 1,200 milligrams per day for both men and women.\n* Also to help protect bones, vitamin D recommendations increase from 600 IU to 800 IU per day for men and women.\n* Vitamin B6 recommendations rise to 1.7 milligrams per day for older men and 1.5 milligrams per day for older women to help lower levels of homocysteine and protect against cardiovascular disease.\n* Due to a decrease in the production of stomach acid, which can lead to an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine and decrease absorption of vitamin B12, older adults need an additional 2.4 micrograms per day of B12 compared to younger adults.\n* For elderly women, higher iron levels are no longer needed post-menopause, and recommendations decrease from 18 milligrams per day to 8 milligrams per day.",
