However, zooming in to look at the most basic elements of living things\u2014from atoms to molecules to cells\u2014we can start to see similarities and patterns that help us make sense of this complexity. And as we consider biological processes, such as photosynthesis, digestion, and metabolism, we also see how these processes fit together. Plants use photosynthesis to capture energy from the sun. Animals, humans included, eat the plants (or other animals that ate the plants) and use the processes of digestion and metabolism to utilize the energy they contain. In the process of energy metabolism, animals breathe out carbon dioxide, which is then used by plants for photosynthesis. It\u2019s truly a circle of life!\nIn this unit, we\u2019ll also zero in on the digestive system. While all organ systems relate to nutrition in some way, the digestive system takes center stage as the site of food processing and nutrient extraction. And while it usually functions as an efficient and coordinated system, we\u2019ll also consider some common ways that it can go awry, resulting in disorders and discomforts of the digestive tract or adverse reactions to certain foods.",

It is convenient to consider the structures of the body in terms of fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, and organisms. Higher levels of organization are built from lower levels. Therefore, atoms combine to form molecules, molecules combine to form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues combine to form organs, organs combine to form organ systems, and organ systems combine to form organisms (Figure 3.1).\nFigure 3.1.

Who you are has been determined because of two cells that came together inside your mother\u2019s womb. The two cells containing all of your genetic information (DNA) fused to begin the development of a new organism. Cells divided and differentiated into other cells with specific roles that led to the formation of the body\u2019s numerous organs, systems, blood, blood vessels, bones, tissues, and skin. While all cells in an individual contain the same DNA, each cell only expresses the genetic codes that relate to that cell\u2019s specific structure and function.\nAs an adult, you are made up of trillions of cells. Each of your individual cells is a compact and efficient form of life\u2014self-sufficient, yet interdependent upon the other cells within your body to supply its needs. There are hundreds of types of cells (e.g., red blood cells, nerve cells, skin cells). Each individual cell conducts all the basic processes of life. It must take in nutrients, excrete wastes, detect and respond to its environment, move, breathe, grow, and reproduce. Many cells have a short life span and have to be replaced continually. For example, enterocytes (cells that line the intestines) are replaced every 2-4 days, and skin cells are replaced every few weeks.\nAlthough a cell is defined as the \u201cmost basic\u201d unit of life, it is structurally and functionally complex (Figure 3.2). A human cell typically consists of a flexible outer cell membrane\u00a0(also called a plasma membrane) that encloses cytoplasm, a water-based cellular fluid, together with a variety of functioning units called organelles. The organelles are like tiny organs constructed from several macromolecules bonded together. A typical animal cell contains the following organelles:\n* Nucleus: houses genetic material (DNA)\n* Mitochondria: often called the powerhouse of the cell, generates usable energy for the cell from energy-yielding nutrients\n* Ribosomes: assemble proteins based on genetic code\n* Endoplasmic reticulum: processes and packages proteins and lipids\n* Golgi apparatus(golgi body): distributes macromolecules like proteins and lipids around the cell\n* Lysosomes: digestive pouches which break down macromolecules and destroy foreign invaders\nFigure 3.2.

There are four basic types of human tissues: connective tissue, which connects tissues; epithelial tissue, which lines and protects organs; muscle, which contracts for movement and support; and nerve, which responds and reacts to signals in the environment.\nAn organ\u00a0is a group of similar tissues arranged in a specific manner to perform a specific physiological function. Examples include the brain, liver, and heart. An organ systemis a group of two or more organs that work together to perform a specific physiological function. Examples include the digestive system and central nervous system.\nThere are eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (Figure 3.3). Assigning organs to organ systems can be imprecise since organs that \u201cbelong\u201d to one system can also have functions integral to another system. In fact, many organs contribute to more than one system. And most of these organ systems are involved in nutrition-related functions within the body (Table 3.1). For example, the cardiovascular system plays a role in nutrition by transporting nutrients in the blood to the cells of the body. The endocrine system produces hormones, many of which are involved in regulating appetite, digestive processes, and nutrient levels in the blood. Even the reproductive system plays a role in providing nutrition to a developing fetus or growing baby.\nFigure 3.3.

It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates from sunlight and convert it into a chemical compound (glucose) that every organism uses to power its daily functions. Photosynthesis is also a source of oxygen necessary for many living organisms.\nThe importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight\u2019s energy. Photosynthesis is vital because it provides a way to capture the energy from solar radiation (the \u201cphoto-\u201d part) and store that energy in the carbon-carbon bonds of glucose (the \u201c-synthesis\u201d part). Glucose is the main energy source that animals and humans use to power the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the energy-containing molecule found in the cells of all animals and humans. Energy from the foods we eat is captured in ATP and used to fuel the workload of cells.1\nThe energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. Consider a predator, such as a wolf, preying on a deer. The wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from atoms colliding on the surface of the sun, to visible light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to the deer, and finally to the wolf. The\u00a0wolf, by feeding on the deer, receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed.\nOur food supply is also directly linked to photosynthesis. Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume. Although there is a large variety, each item ultimately can be linked back to photosynthesis. Meat and dairy link because the animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar\u2014sucrose is a plant product, a carbohydrate molecule, which is also derived from photosynthesis. Many items are less obviously derived from plants: virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. (Salt is a notable exception.) Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes.",

    "content": "Photosynthesis generally takes place in the leaves of plants. It is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2, found in the air), and water (H2O, from the soil). After the process is complete, the plant releases oxygen into the air (O2, essential for many living organisms) and produces the simple carbohydrate molecule of glucose, which can be used as an energy source by the plant, converted to starch and stored for a later energy source, or converted into other organic molecules such as fats, proteins and vitamins. This glucose contains the energy that all living organisms need to survive.\nFigure 3.5. Depiction of photosynthesis in plants. The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant.\nThe basic formula for photosynthesis is as follows:\n6CO2 + 6H2O + sun\u2019s energy = C6H12O6 + 6O2\nAnother way of saying this:\n| Photosynthesis uses: | 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (6CO2) 6 molecules of water (6H2O) the sun\u2019s energy |\n| --- | --- |\n| Photosynthesis produces: | 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) 6 molecules of oxygen (6O2) |\n|  |  |\nStarch is the storage form of glucose in plants, stored in seeds, roots, and tubers for later use as an energy source for the plant to reproduce. When a seed is buried deep in the soil, this starch can be broken down into glucose to be used for energy for the seed to sprout. As the seed sprouts, and shoots go above the ground and leaves start to form, the new plant can then photosynthesize glucose for an energy source. When we eat foods that contain starch, we must digest that starch down into single sugars (glucose) in order for the glucose to be absorbed into the intestinal cells, where it will enter the bloodstream to be carried to all cells of the body to use as an energy source. The basic process of digestion of these foods will be covered in the next section.",

    "content": "All living things require energy to survive. For humans, and many other organisms, that energy is generated by the complex interaction of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a key pathway in energy metabolism\u00a0(the process of converting food into energy) of all aerobic organisms. Respiration\u00a0refers to breathing: taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. But ultimately, the reason we need to breathe is to provide the oxygen needed to carry out cellular respiration in our cells and to remove the carbon dioxide that is produced as a byproduct.\nIn the process of cellular respiration, energy that is stored in the food we eat is converted to the body\u2019s energy currency, ATP, while a small amount is lost as heat. During cellular respiration, glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide and water; in the process, ATP is released. Cellular respiration occurs in part in the mitochondria of cells and is an aerobic process, which means that oxygen is required. It is a series of reactions that can be summarized as follows:\nglucose + 6O2 \u2192 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy (ATP and heat)\nAnother way of saying this:\n| Cellular respiration uses: | 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) 6 molecules of oxygen (6O2) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cellular respiration produces: | 6 molecules of carbon dioxide (6CO2) 6 molecules of water (6H2O) Energy |\n|  |  |\nEven though glucose is the starting substance used in cellular respiration, we do not consume only glucose as an energy source. Instead, many different kinds of food molecules are broken down into smaller molecules, metabolized, and then enter the cellular respiration pathway. For example, complex carbohydrates like starch are readily converted to glucose. Fats and proteins can also be used in cellular respiration, but they must be modified before they can feed into the process.\nFigure 3.6. Nutrients fuel cellular respiration. Other carbohydrates, like starch and sugars, are converted to glucose before entering cellular respiration.",

The relationship between the reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.\nThe cycling that occurs between photosynthesis and cellular respiration is vital to the health of planet Earth. If there was no way for the carbon dioxide produced through cellular respiration to be utilized, breathing organisms (like humans and animals) would soon suffocate. Additionally, photosynthetic organisms are at the base of almost every food chain on the planet, so without these organisms, mass starvation would result. Luckily, this planet is full of organisms capable of photosynthesis (e.g., trees and grass on land and algae and bacteria in the ocean). Without this vital connection between photosynthesis and cellular respiration, life as we know it would cease to exist.\nFigure 3.8. The photosynthesis-cellular respiration cycle.

Although the small intestine is the workhorse of the system where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs, each of the digestive system organs makes a vital contribution to this process.\nThe easiest way to understand the digestive system is to divide its organs into two main categories: the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the accessory organs.\n* The GI tract\u00a0is a one-way tube about 25 feet in length, beginning at the mouth and ending at the anus. Between these two points, the GI tract also contains the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and the rectum. The small intestine is comprised of three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The large intestine, also called the colon, is similarly divided into three sections: the ascending colon, transverse colon, and descending colon. Both the mouth and anus are open to the external environment; thus, food and wastes within the GI tract are technically considered to be outside the body. Only through the process of absorption do the nutrients in food enter into and nourish the body\u2019s \u201cinner space.\u201d\n* Accessory organs, despite their name, are critical to the function of the digestive system. They are considered accessory organs since they are not actually part of the intestinal tract itself, but have ducts that deliver digestive juices into the tract to help aid in digestion. There are four accessory organs: the salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. All of these organs secrete fluids containing a variety of chemicals such as enzymes and acids that aid in digestion.\nFigure 3.9. An overview of the organs involved in digestion. The parts of the GI tract are highlighted in blue, and the accessory organs are highlighted in yellow.",

    "content": "The process of digestion includes five main activities: ingestion, mechanical digestion, chemical digestion, absorption, and excretion.\nThe first of these processes, ingestion, refers to the entry of food into the GI tract through the mouth. There, the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down the carbohydrates and lipids in food. Mastication\u00a0(chewing) increases the surface area of the food and allows for food to be broken into small enough pieces to be swallowed safely.\nFood (now called a bolus\u00a0since it has been chewed and moistened) leaves the mouth when the tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel the bolus into the esophagus. The bolus will travel down the esophagus through an involuntary process called peristalsis. Peristalsis\u00a0consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscles in the GI tract, which act to propel food along (Figure 3.10). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head.\nFigure 3.10. Peristalsis moves food through the digestive tract with alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation.\nDigestion includes both mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical digestion\u00a0is a purely physical process of making food particles smaller to increase both surface area and mobility. Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical nature of the food. It includes mastication, tongue movements that help break food into smaller bits and mix it with saliva, mixing and churning of the stomach to further break food apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, and peristalsis to help move food along the intestinal tract. Segmentation is also an example of mechanical digestion. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the GI tract. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal tract, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\nFigure 3.11. Segmentation separates chyme and then pushes it back together, mixing it and providing time for digestion and absorption.\nIn chemical digestion, digestive secretions that contain enzymes start to break down the macronutrients into their chemical building blocks (for example, starch into glucose). Enzymes\u00a0are chemicals that help speed up or facilitate chemical reactions in the body. They bring together two compounds to react, without undergoing any changes themselves. For example, the main chemical reaction in digestion is hydrolysis.Hydrolysis\u00a0is the splitting of one molecule into two with the addition of water. For example, the sugar sucrose (a double sugar) needs to be broken down to its building blocks, glucose and fructose (both single sugars), before it can be absorbed. This breakdown happens through hydrolysis, and the enzyme, sucrase, brings together the sucrose molecule and the water molecule to react. This process is illustrated in the following animation.\nVideo: Enzyme Action and the Hydrolysis of Sucrose by McGraw-Hill Animations, YouTube (June 3, 2017). 1:46 minutes.\nNutrients are of little to no value to the body unless they enter the bloodstream. This occurs through the process of absorption, which takes place primarily within the small intestine. There, most nutrients are absorbed from the lumen\u00a0(or inside space) of the GI tract into the bloodstream. Larger lipids are absorbed into lymph but eventually enter the bloodstream as well.\nIn excretion, the final step of digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body as feces. The feces is stored in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus.",

An important function of the stomach is to serve as a temporary holding chamber. You can ingest a meal far more quickly than it can be digested and absorbed by the small intestine. Thus, the stomach holds food and secretes only small amounts into the small intestine at a time. (The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates. It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach contents completely into the small intestine.)\nWhen the peanut butter and jelly sandwich enters the stomach, a highly muscular organ, powerful peristaltic contractions help mash, pulverize, and churn it into chyme. Chyme\u00a0is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food along with gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach.\u00a0These gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid, which lowers the pH of the chyme in the stomach. This acidic environment kills many bacteria or other germs that may have been present in the food, and it causes the three-dimensional structure of dietary proteins to unfold. Gastric juices also contain the enzyme pepsin, which begins the chemical breakdown of proteins in the peanut butter and bread.\u00a0Gastric lipase\u00a0continues the breakdown of fat from the peanut butter.",

The small intestine is divided into three parts, all part of one continuous tube: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.\nOnce the chyme enters the duodenum\u00a0(the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas and gallbladder are stimulated to release juices that aid in digestion. The pancreas\u00a0(located behind the stomach) produces and secretes pancreatic juices which consist mostly of water, but also contain bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The small intestine\u2019s absorptive cells also synthesize digestive enzymes that aid in the breakdown of sugars and proteins.\nThe gallbladder\u00a0(a small sac located behind the liver) stores, concentrates, and secretes a fluid called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile is made in the liver\u00a0and stored in the gallbladder. Bile\u00a0is an emulsifier; it acts similar to a detergent (that would remove grease from a frying pan) by breaking large fat droplets into smaller fat droplets so they can mix with the watery digestive juices.\nPeristalsis and segmentation control the movement and mixing of chyme through the small intestine. As in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis consists of circular waves of smooth muscle contractions that propel food forward. Segmentation helps to mix food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\nNutrient absorption takes place mainly in the latter part of the small intestine, the ileum.\u00a0The small intestine is perfectly structured for maximizing nutrient absorption. Its surface area is greater than 200 square meters\u2014about the size of a tennis court! The large surface area is due to the multiple levels of folding, villi, and microvilli that cover the internal tissue of the small intestine. Villi\u00a0are tiny finger-like projections that are covered with enterocytes\u00a0or absorptive cells. The absorptive cell membrane is made of even smaller projections, called microvilli\u00a0(Figure 3.12). These microvilli are referred to collectively as the brush border\u00a0since their appearance resembles the bristles on a brush.\nFigure 3.12. Histology of the small intestine. (a) The absorptive surface of the small intestine is vastly enlarged by the presence of circular folds, villi, and microvilli. (b) Micrograph of the circular folds. (c) Micrograph of the villi. (d) Electron micrograph of the microvilli.\nDigested nutrients are absorbed into either capillaries or lymphatic vessels contained within each villus. Amino acids (from protein digestion), small fatty acids (from triglyceride digestion), sugars (from carbohydrate digestion), water-soluble vitamins, and minerals are transported from the intestinal cells into the bloodstream through capillaries. The larger fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids (that are packaged in lipid transport particles) are transported first through lymphatic vessels and then eventually meet up with the blood. Water-soluble nutrients that enter the bloodstream are transported directly to the liver where the liver processes, stores, or releases these nutrients to other body cells.\nFigure 3.13.

Any components that still remain (usually less than ten percent of food consumed) and the indigestible fiber move from the small intestine to the large intestine\u00a0(colon). A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the remaining water. Water is present not only from the solid foods and beverages consumed, but also the digestive juices released by the stomach and pancreas. As water is reabsorbed, liquid chyme becomes a semisolid, referred to as feces. Feces\u00a0is composed of undigested food residues, unabsorbed digested substances, millions of bacteria, old cells from the lining of the GI tract, inorganic salts, and enough water to let it pass smoothly out of the body.\nFeces is stored in the rectum\u00a0(a temporary holding area) until it is expelled through the anus via defecation. No further chemical breakdown of food takes place in the large intestine except that accomplished by the bacteria that inhabit this portion of the GI tract. There are trillions of bacteria residing in the large intestine (referred to as the bacterial flora), exceeding the total number of cells in the human body. This may seem rather unpleasant, but the great majority of bacteria in the large intestine are harmless and many are even beneficial\u2014facilitating chemical digestion and absorption, improving immune function, and synthesizing vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, and vitamin K.\nThe figure below summarizes the functions of the digestive organs.\nFigure 3.14.

    "content": "Heartburn\u00a0is a burning, often painful, sensation in the chest (behind the breastbone) or throat. Heartburn is caused by gastroesophageal reflux (GER), when the acidic chyme in the stomach escapes back into the esophagus and even into the mouth. Normally, this reflux is prevented by the lower esophageal sphincter (a tight ring of muscle) that sits between the esophagus and stomach. The muscles of the sphincter contract to keep it closed, only relaxing to allow food boluses and liquid to pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then quickly contracting again to keep the contents of the stomach separate from the esophagus. The lower esophageal sphincter can be weakened because of increased pressure on the abdomen from obesity or pregnancy, exposure to tobacco smoke, and some medications, so the risk of GER is increased in these scenarios.\nFigure 3.15. In gastroesophageal reflux, the acidic contents of the stomach escape backwards into the esophagus, causing pain and burning sensations in the chest and/or throat.\nOccasional heartburn is a common complaint, especially after eating large greasy or spicy meals. However, if it occurs more than twice per week, it may be diagnosed as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which should be treated not only to relieve the discomfort that it causes but also to prevent damage to the tissues of the esophagus, which can increase the risk of cancer. In addition to heartburn, GER and GERD can cause difficult and painful swallowing, a persistent sore throat or cough, a sense that there\u2019s a lump in your throat, and nausea and vomiting.\nThe symptoms of GER and GERD can often be addressed through diet and lifestyle changes, including the following:\n* Avoid foods that seem to trigger symptoms. Common culprits are greasy or spicy foods, chocolate, coffee, peppermint, alcohol, and acidic foods such as tomatoes or citrus.\n* Eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large meals.\n* Avoid eating 3 hours before bedtime, and stay upright for 3 hours after eating.\n* Wear clothing that is loose around the abdomen.\n* Raise the head of your bed by 6 to 8 inches by placing blocks under the bedposts. (Extra pillows will not help.)\n* Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke, if needed.\n* Lose weight, if needed.\nOver-the-counter medications like antacids (Maalox, Mylanta, Rolaids) can also help with occasional heartburn. If symptoms are persistent and frequent, it\u2019s wise to see a doctor to be checked out for GERD and to discuss other treatment and medication options.1,2",

    "content": "Peptic ulcers\u00a0are sores on the tissues lining the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). They occur when the mucous coating the GI tissues is damaged, exposing the tissue to pepsin and hydrochloric acid. This further erodes away the tissues, causing pain if it damages a nerve and bleeding if it damages a blood vessel. Ulcers are most serious if they perforate the wall of the GI tract, which can cause a serious infection. Peptic ulcers cause stomach pain, often when the stomach is empty, and may go away when you eat or take antacids. In the most serious cases, blood may be seen in vomit and/or the stool, and the patient may have very sharp and persistent stomach pain.\nFigure 3.16. Peptic ulcers. (A) The location of a peptic ulcer in the stomach. (B) A photo from an endoscopy of a patient with an ulcer in the duodenum.\nDoctors used to believe that stress and excessive stomach acid caused peptic ulcers, so they would recommend a bland diet, stress reduction, and acid-suppressing medications as treatment. However, these treatments often didn\u2019t work, because they weren\u2019t actually treating the root cause of the ulcers. We now know that there are two main causes of peptic ulcers. The first and most common cause is infection with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori infection is very common, with about 50% of the population worldwide harboring the bacteria, most of them living without any symptoms. It\u2019s not certain how people are infected with H. pylori or why they cause ulcers in some people and not in others. However, understanding the link between H. pylori and ulcers was an important discovery, because it led to effective treatments. The H. pylori bacteria are able to survive the acidic environment of the stomach, and they damage the mucous coating of the GI tract, leaving it vulnerable to further damage from acid and pepsin. Ulcers caused by H. pylori infection are treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria, with the addition of an acid-suppressing medication to allow the tissue to heal.\nThe second major cause of peptic ulcers is long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen. One of the side effects of NSAIDS is that they block the production of an enzyme that protects the stomach lining, so using these medications frequently and chronically can increase the risk of developing a stomach ulcer. To treat an ulcer caused by NSAIDs, doctors recommend stopping or reducing the use of NSAIDs. They may also prescribe an acid-reducing medication to allow the tissue to heal.3",

    "content": "Both diarrhea\u00a0and constipation\u00a0can occur if the normal function and rhythm of the GI tract is disrupted. If waste matter moves too quickly through the large intestine, not enough water is absorbed, resulting in the loose, watery stools characteristic of diarrhea. This is most commonly caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella), viruses (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus), or parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium enteritis, Giardia lamblia). Dietary allergies and intolerances can also cause diarrhea, as we\u2019ll discuss on the next page. Complications of diarrhea include dehydration and malabsorption of nutrients.4\nOn the other end of the spectrum is constipation, characterized by infrequent bowel movements (less than 3 times per week) with stools that are hard, dry, or lumpy, and often painful to pass. Sometimes, constipation is caused by holding stool and delaying defecation. That gives the colon and rectum additional time to absorb water, making the feces too hard and dry. Delaying defecation is common in children or others who may fear that it will hurt to pass a stool, but of course, holding it only worsens the problem. Constipation can also occur due to other disruptions in daily rhythms, such as changing what or how much you eat, travel, or medication changes. Constipation is common in pregnancy due to hormonal changes. It also becomes more common with age, which may be due to decreased physical activity, medication use, or weakness in the smooth muscle of the intestine. Constipation can be a sign of another medical problem, so chronic constipation should be checked out by a doctor.\nConstipation can often be addressed by dietary changes, including eating more high-fiber foods (whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc.) and drinking more water. It can also be helpful to attempt a bowel movement after meals, when the intestine is more active, and to make that a habit to try to establish more regularity in bowel movements. A caffeinated beverage with breakfast can help, as can increasing physical activity.\nFiber supplements such as Metamucil, Citrucel, or Benefiber can be helpful for increasing fiber intake and addressing constipation, at least in the short term. However, it\u2019s preferable to transition to dietary sources of fiber, as they come packaged with many other valuable nutrients.\nLaxatives may also be helpful to address constipation in the short-term but are usually not a good long-term solution. It\u2019s possible to become dependent on some types of laxatives for bowel movements, meaning that the colon doesn\u2019t contract normally on its own. In these cases, a doctor can help make a plan to gradually reduce laxative use and find other ways to improve bowel regularity.4",

People suffering from IBS often experience abdominal pain, bloating, the feeling that they can\u2019t finish a bowel movement, as well as diarrhea or constipation or both, often in cycles. IBS is common; about 12% of people in the U.S. are thought to have it. It\u2019s more common in women, seems to run in families, and is often associated with stress, history of trauma, or severe GI infections. IBS isn\u2019t well understood. It\u2019s not clear what causes it, and it may have different causes in different people.5\nOf course, since the cause of IBS isn\u2019t understood, that lack of understanding makes it difficult to treat. Some people find that eating more fiber-rich foods and increasing physical activity improve their symptoms, so these are good first steps (and good for health regardless of their effect on IBS). Others find that following a diet that is low in carbohydrates called FODMAPs helps their symptoms. FODMAPs are fermentable carbohydrates found in many foods and can usually be eaten without issue by most people. Foods that are high in FODMAPs include fruits, vegetables, legumes, dairy products, wheat, and honey, so this is a very restrictive diet and should only be attempted with the guidance of a dietitian. Without careful planning, a low-FODMAP diet can be deficient in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. It is usually followed for just a few weeks, and if it helps with symptoms, foods are gradually added back to see what can be tolerated.6,7\nIn addition to dietary strategies, physicians sometimes prescribe medications to treat the symptoms of diarrhea or constipation associated with IBS.8",

It\u2019s important to get an accurate diagnosis of IBD in order to treat the disorder appropriately.9\nCommon symptoms of IBD are diarrhea, cramping and abdominal pain, feeling tired, and weight loss. IBD may be caused by autoimmune reactions (in which the immune system attacks the body\u2019s own cells, in this case the cells of the GI tract) or certain genes, and other causes are being investigated. IBD often develops in people during adolescence or in their 20s. It may be treated with medications to reduce inflammation or modulate the immune system, or sometimes surgery.10,11",

    "content": "A food intolerance\u00a0occurs when a person has difficulty digesting a specific food or nutrient, causing unpleasant GI symptoms such as gas, bloating, flatulence, cramping, and diarrhea. Food intolerances are commonly caused by the body not producing enough of a particular digestive enzyme, so the symptoms generally involve the digestive system, and the severity of symptoms usually correlates with how much of the food was eaten. Unlike food allergies, the immune system does not play a role in food intolerance, and while the symptoms are unpleasant, they are generally not dangerous and will subside once the food passes out of the GI tract. People with food intolerances can also often consume small amounts of the offending food without symptoms.1\nLactose intolerance\u00a0is a common food intolerance. People with lactose intolerance do not produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is responsible for digesting the milk sugar lactose into single sugar molecules that can be absorbed in the small intestine. Undigested lactose can\u2019t be absorbed, so it continues on to the large intestine. There, it draws more water into the large intestine, and bacteria metabolize the lactose, resulting in gas and acid production. These conditions cause the uncomfortable symptoms of gas, bloating, and diarrhea within about 30 minutes to two hours of consuming dairy foods.\nAs with most food intolerances, people with lactose intolerance can often consume some amount of lactose without discomfort, although this varies from person to person. Aged hard cheese, buttermilk, and yogurt (as long as it doesn\u2019t include added milk solids) are often well-tolerated because they are low in lactose, which is consumed by bacteria during fermentation and aging. In addition, lactose-free milk and lactase enzyme supplements are available. Dairy products are some of the main dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D, so people who avoid dairy need to take special care to include other sources of these nutrients in their diets.2\nFigure 3.17. Taking a lactase enzyme supplement allows many people with lactose intolerance to eat dairy products without suffering symptoms.\nThe vast majority of humans are born with the ability to digest lactose. All mammalian milk, including human milk, contains lactose, so historically, infants with lactose intolerance wouldn\u2019t have survived. (Today, infants with lactose intolerance can consume soy-based infant formula.) Beyond infancy, lactose intolerance depends on your genes. In much of the world, it\u2019s common for the activity of the lactase gene to decline with age, resulting in less lactase production and more lactose intolerance. Worldwide, 65% of the human population has some degree of lactose intolerance in adulthood. On the other hand, lactose tolerance is common in cultures where early domestication of dairy animals provided an important source of nutrition. In the U.S., adults of European descent can often tolerate lactose, whereas lactose intolerance is common among Asian Americans, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans.3\nFigure 3.18.

    "content": "In addition to its role in digestion, the GI tract serves an important immune function. Intestinal cells form the barrier between the interior of the body and the lumen, or tube, of the GI tract, which is technically outside of the body and teeming with potential pathogens. Immune tissue in the GI tract and other parts of the body produce immune cells that target foreign invaders, in part through the production of antibodies, protective proteins that bind to foreign substances. However, this function requires the immune system to accurately distinguish between normal food proteins and invading pathogens. A food allergy\u00a0is what happens if the immune system mistakenly identifies a food protein as an invasive threat.\nThe most common type of food allergy involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of antibody produced by the immune system in response to a specific substance, orallergen. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur immediately after consuming the food (i.e., within seconds to minutes), although reactions can sometimes be delayed by two hours or more. Because an allergic reaction is caused by the immune system, it can lead to symptoms all over the body, including skin rashes; swollen lips, face, or throat; wheezing and difficulty breathing; nausea and vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; and rarely, a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A severe allergic reaction involving more than one organ system\u2014a rash coupled with difficulty breathing, for example\u2014is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and should be treated immediately with epinephrine, commonly administered by injection with a device such as an EpiPen, and then person should seek immediate medical attention.1\nFigure 3.19. Common food allergens: peanuts, dairy, wheat, eggs, and shrimp. At right, an EpiPen, containing injectable epinephrine, is pictured. \nThe most common food allergies in the U.S. are caused by proteins in peanuts, tree nuts, milk, shellfish, eggs, fish, wheat, soy and sesame.4,5 A 2019 study reported that 19% of adults in the U.S. believe they\u2019re allergic to at least one food. After asking people about their symptoms, the researchers estimated that the true incidence of food allergies is closer to 11%, while the remaining 8% of people likely have a food intolerance.4\nFood allergies are common in children, affecting about 8% of U.S. children, although allergies can also develop later in life.5 It\u2019s common for young children to outgrow allergies to egg, dairy, wheat, or soy, but peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies are often lifelong. Recent research has found that letting babies eat common food allergens, particularly peanut products, can prevent the development of allergies, perhaps by allowing the immune system an early opportunity to learn to differentiate between food proteins and invading pathogens.6\nIf you think you may have a food allergy, it\u2019s important to see an allergist to ensure you have an accurate diagnosis. Food allergies are diagnosed based on symptoms after consuming a food, specific IgE blood tests, and/or skin prick tests, where a tiny amount of food protein is scratched onto the skin to test for a reaction. Blood and skin tests determine whether a person is sensitized to an allergen, meaning that they\u2019re producing IgE antibodies to the food. However, the presence of IgE antibodies doesn\u2019t definitively mean a person has a food allergy; it\u2019s common to have a positive IgE test but still be able to eat the food without symptoms. The gold standard test for diagnosing is an oral food challenge\u2014consuming a small amount of the food and watching for signs of a reaction\u2014although due to time, cost, and risk, these are not always conducted. If you are diagnosed with a food allergy, you will be counseled to strictly avoid the food and carry injectable epinephrine in case of accidental consumption.",

The first of these therapies was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2020.7\nThere are blood tests available that claim to screen for as many as 90 to 100 food allergies from one blood sample.

    "content": "Celiac disease\u00a0is an autoimmune disorder affecting between 0.5 and 1.0% of people in the U.S., or one in every 100 to 200 people.9 In\u00a0autoimmune diseases, the immune system produces antibodies that attack and damage the body\u2019s own tissues. In the case of celiac disease, the body has an abnormal immune reaction to gluten\u00a0(a group of proteins found in wheat, rye, \u00a0and barley), causing antibodies to attack the cells lining the small intestine. This results in damage to the villi, decreasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. There is no cure for celiac disease, but it\u2019s very effectively treated by eliminating gluten from the diet.10\nSymptoms of celiac disease can range from mild to severe and can include pale, fatty, loose stools, gastrointestinal upset, constipation, abdominal pain, and skin conditions. Nutrient malabsorption can lead to weight loss and in children, a failure to grow and thrive. Symptoms can appear in infancy or much later in life, as late as age seventy. Celiac disease is not always diagnosed, because the symptoms may be mild. Even without symptoms, the disease can still damage the small intestine and impair nutrient absorption. Nutrient deficiencies can cause health problems over time, particularly in children and the elderly. For example, poor absorption of iron and folic acid can cause anemia, which impairs oxygen transport to cells in the body. Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies can lead to osteoporosis, a disease in which bones become brittle.\nDiagnosis of celiac disease begins with a blood test for specific antibodies that are elevated in those with the disease. If the blood test is positive, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy of the small intestine, a procedure in which a small amount of tissue is removed for examination. These tests may not accurately detect celiac disease in people already consuming a gluten-free diet, because without gluten, antibody levels may be low and damage to the small intestine may not be visible. This is why it\u2019s best to be tested for celiac before eliminating gluten from the diet.\nIt isn\u2019t clear what causes celiac disease; genetics play a role, but other factors also seem to influence its development. Celiac disease is most common in people of European descent and is rare in people of African American, Japanese, and Chinese descent. It is more prevalent in women and in people with type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Down and Turner syndromes.\nCeliac disease is treated by completely avoiding gluten, as consuming even small amounts can cause intestinal damage. People with celiac can consume grains that don\u2019t contain gluten, including rice, corn, millet, buckwheat, and quinoa. Oats can be consumed, although they are often contaminated with gluten from neighboring fields or shared processing equipment, so it\u2019s best to buy oats labeled gluten-free. There are also an increasing number of gluten-free products available in stores. After eliminating gluten from the diet, the tissues of the small intestine usually heal within six months.\nFigure 3.20. Celiac disease is caused by an autoimmune response to gluten, found in wheat, rye, and barley. At right is a section of the small intestine from a biopsy, visualized under a microscope, from a celiac patient. The villi, which would normally be finger-like projections, are blunted and flattened by damage caused by the disease. \nCeliac disease is different from a wheat allergy in both cause and symptoms. Because celiac disease is an autoimmune condition, the cells of the small intestine come under attack, and damage causes chronic symptoms. A wheat allergy, on the other hand, is caused by antibodies attacking an allergen in the wheat itself, and the symptoms are usually immediate and acute.\nSometimes, people test negative for celiac disease but still believe that consuming gluten is causing symptoms, usually gastrointestinal in nature. They may eliminate gluten from their diet and find that they feel better.",

However, carbohydrates are found not just in grains, or in sweets and processed foods, but in every food group.\nIn fact, carbohydrates are the most abundant nutrient (except water) in the diets of most humans around the world. Since the dawn of agriculture, human cultures have relied on staple grains, such as corn, rice, and wheat, as the foundation of their diets, and these foods are rich in carbohydrates. But fruits and vegetables, dairy products, legumes, and nuts also have naturally-occurring carbohydrates. And of course, carbohydrates are a key ingredient in desserts, sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas, and many of the packaged snack foods that are readily available and\u2014let\u2019s face it\u2014can be hard to stop eating.\nIn other words, if someone says they eat a high carbohydrate diet, that could mean many different things. They very well could be talking about a balanced diet focused on whole foods, like this:\nFigure 4.3. Examples of whole foods containing carbohydrates, including fresh fruit, legumes and grains, and cheese.\nThe diet industry likes to sell us simple messages about \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d foods, and these days, we tend to hear that carbohydrates are in the \u201cbad\u201d group. But given that carbohydrates are in so many different types of foods, that\u2019s obviously an oversimplified message\u2014and it\u2019s not fair to all of the awesome sources of carbohydrates in the world of food. Not all carbohydrate-rich foods are the same. In this unit, you\u2019ll learn to appreciate the nutrient-dense carbohydrate foods, identify which don\u2019t offer as valuable a nutritional package, and understand how a balanced diet can include all of them.",

Simple carbohydrates are made up of just one or two sugar units, whereas complex carbohydrates are made up of many sugar units. We\u2019ll look at each of these in turn.

Plants make a lot of fructose as a way of attracting insects and animals, which help plants to reproduce. For example, plants make nectar, which is high in fructose and very sweet, to attract insects that will pollinate it. Plants also put fructose into fruit to make it tastier. Animals eat the fruit, wander away, and later poop out the seeds from the fruit, thereby sowing the seeds of the next generation. Animal gets a meal, and the plant gets to reproduce: win-win!\nFigure 4.5. Fructose in nature: A bee collects sweet nectar from a flower, in the process spreading pollen from flower to flower and helping plants to reproduce. Bees use nectar to make honey, which humans harvest for use as a sweetener. (Honey contains a mix of sucrose, fructose, and glucose). A kiwi is sweetened in part by fructose. Animals enjoy the sweet fruit and then later poop out the seeds, sowing them for a new generation of kiwi trees. \nFood sources of fructose: Fruits, vegetables, honey, high fructose corn syrup",

Grains contain a lot of starch, which is made of long chains of glucose (more on this in a minute), and when the seed of a grain starts to sprout, it begins to break down that starch, creating maltose. If bread is made from those sprouted grains, that bread will have some maltose. Sprouted grain bread is usually a little heavier and sweeter than bread made from regular flour.\nMaltose also plays a role in the production of beer and liquor, because this process involves the fermentation of grains or other carbohydrate sources. Maltose is formed during the breakdown of those carbohydrates, but there is very little remaining once the fermentation process is complete.\nYou can taste the sweetness of maltose if you hold a starchy food in your mouth for a minute or so.

As we\u2019ll discuss more later, what\u2019s different is the package the sugars come in.

Plants make starch in order to store glucose. For example, starch is in seeds to give the seedling energy to sprout, and we eat those seeds in the form of grains, legumes (soybeans, lentils, pinto and kidney beans, for example), nuts, and seeds. Starch is also stored in roots and tubers to provide stored energy for the plant to grow and reproduce, and we eat these in the form of potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, and turnips.\nWhen we eat plant foods with starch, we can break it down into glucose to provide fuel for our body\u2019s cells.

The branched structure of glycogen makes it easier to break down quickly to release glucose to serve as fuel when needed on short notice.\nLiver glycogen is broken down to glucose, which is released into the bloodstream and can be used by cells around the body. Muscle glycogen provides energy only for muscle, to fuel activity. That can come in handy if you\u2019re being chased by a lion, or sprinting to make your bus! Both liver and muscle glycogen serve as relatively short-term forms of energy storage; together, they can only provide enough glucose to last for about 24 hours in a person fasting or eating a very low carbohydrate diet.\nEven though glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles of animals, we don\u2019t find it in meat, because it\u2019s broken down soon after slaughter. Thus, glycogen is not found in our food. Instead, we have to make it in our liver and muscle from glucose.\nHere\u2019s a beautiful depiction of glycogen.\nFigure 4.6.

Choose MyPlate graphic illustrating the USDA food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein and dairy.\nFruits\u2013 Fruits are sweet, so we know they must contain sugar. Fruits contain sucrose, glucose, and fructose. This sugar is naturally-occurring and comes packaged with other great nutrients, like Vitamin C and potassium. Whole fruit also contains fiber, since fiber is found in all whole plant foods. Juice has little to no fiber, even high pulp orange juice.\nVegetables\u2013 Some vegetables are sweet and also contain sugar, although much less than fruit. Similar to fruits, some vegetables (like carrots and green beans) contain small amounts of sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Starchy vegetables (corn, peas, and potatoes, for example) primarily contain starch but some are also sweet and contain sucrose, glucose, and fructose (sweet potatoes and sweet corn, for example). Just like whole fruit, any whole vegetable also contains fiber.\nGrains\u2013 Grains naturally contain starch and fiber. Sprouted grains also contain maltose. If grains are sweetened (sugar is added), they might contain sucrose (white cane sugar) or fructose and glucose (honey and/or HFCS).\nDairy- This is the one animal food that contains carbohydrate. Milk, cheese, and yogurt contain naturally-occurring lactose. If dairy (like yogurt) is sweetened, then it will also contain added sugar like sucrose (white cane sugar) or fructose and glucose (honey and/or HFCS).\nProtein\u2013 Meats do not contain carbohydrate, but many plant foods that fall into the protein group, like beans and nuts, contain starch and fiber.\nFats\u2013 Concentrated fats like butter and oil do not contain carbohydrate.\nThis information is summarized in the table below:\n| Food Group | Example of Food | Type of Carbohydrate Present |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fruits | Apple, orange, banana Orange juice | Sucrose, glucose, fructose, and fiber Sucrose, glucose, fructose |\n| Vegetables | Non-starchy veggies Starchy veggies (corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, peas) | Sucrose, glucose, fructose, and fiber Starch and fiber, with varying amount of sucrose, glucose, and fructose |\n| Dairy | Milk, plain yogurt, cheese | Lactose |\n| Grains | Wheat, rice, oatmeal, barley Sprouted grains | Starch and fiber Starch, fiber, and maltose |\n| Protein | Meat Beans and nuts | None Starch and fiber |\n| Fats | Oils, Butter | None |\n|  |  |  |\nTable 4.1. USDA food groups with examples of foods and type of carbohydrate present within each food group. \nLooking at all the foods that contain carbohydrates, you might be able to guess why eliminating carbohydrates from the diet can lead to weight loss. It drastically reduces the variety of choices one has, leaving you primarily with low carbohydrate veggies and meats. Not surprisingly, people usually consume less calories with this way of eating. However, for most people, this is not a sustainable or enjoyable way of eating, and it can also be hard to consume a nutritionally balanced diet with so many foods off-limits.",

This is the minimum amount of glucose utilized by the brain, so if you consume less than this, you will probably go into ketosis. In order to meet the body\u2019s high energy demand for glucose, the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for an adult is 45%-65% of total calories. This is about 225 grams to 325 grams of carbohydrate per day if eating a 2,000 Calorie diet. (REMEMBER: 1 gram of carbohydrate contains 4 calories.)\nFiber Intake\nThe Adequate Intake (AI) for fiber is 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories consumed. This is about 28 grams for an adult female (19-30 years old) and 38 grams for an adult male (19-30 years old). Most people in the United States only get half the amount of fiber they need in a day\u2014about 12 to 18 grams.\nAdded Sugar Intake\nThe 2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend that less than 10% of total calories come from added sugars because of its link to obesity and chronic disease. This means that someone eating a 2,000 calorie diet would want to limit their added sugar intake to about 12 teaspoons per day. To put that in perspective, a 12 oz can of soda has about 10 teaspoons of sugar. We will discuss added sugar in more detail later in the unit.\nBelow is a chart summarizing the above recommendations.\n|  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- |\n| RDA for Total Carbohydrate | 130 grams |\n| AMDR for Total Carbohydrate | 45% \u2013 65% of total calories |\n| AI for Fiber | 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed |\n| Dietary guidelines for added sugar | Less than 10% of total calories |\n|  |  |\nTable 4.2 Dietary Recommendations for Carbohydrates",

The enzyme pancreatic amylase breaks starch into smaller polysaccharides and maltose. \nThe rest of the work of carbohydrate digestion is done by enzymes produced by the enterocytes, the cells lining the small intestine. When it comes to digesting your slice of pizza, these enzymes will break down the maltose formed in the process of starch digestion, the lactose from the cheese, and the sucrose present in the sauce.\nMaltose is digested by maltase, forming 2 glucose molecules.\nLactose is digested by lactase, forming glucose and galactose.\nSucrose is digested by sucrase, forming glucose and fructose.\nFigure 4.12. Action of the enzymes maltase, lactase, and sucrase. \n(Recall that if a person is lactose intolerant, they don\u2019t make enough lactase enzyme to digest lactose adequately. Therefore, lactose passes to the large intestine. There it draws water in by osmosis and is fermented by bacteria, causing symptoms such as flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea.)\nBy the end of this process of enzymatic digestion, we\u2019re left with three monosaccharides: glucose, fructose, and galactose. These can now be absorbed across the enterocytes of the small intestine and into the bloodstream to be transported to the liver.\nDigestion and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine are depicted in a very simplified schematic below. (Remember that the inner wall of the small intestine is actually composed of large circular folds, lined with many villi, the surface of which are made up of microvilli. All of this gives the small intestine a huge surface area for absorption.)\nFigure 4.13.

From there, they travel to the liver, where fructose and galactose are converted to glucose.\nAfter any meal containing carbohydrates, you experience a rise in blood glucose that can serve as fuel for cells around the body. But during the periods between meals, including while you\u2019re sleeping and exercising, your body needs fuel, too. To ensure that you have enough glucose in your blood at any given time, your body has a finely-tuned system to regulate your blood glucose concentration. This system allows you to store glucose when you have excess available (when your blood glucose is high) and to pull glucose out from your stores when needed (when your blood supply gets low).\nYour body\u2019s ability to maintain equilibrium or a steady state in your blood glucose concentration is called homeostasis. It\u2019s a critical part of normal physiology, because if your blood glucose gets too low (called hypoglycemia, cellular function starts to fail, especially in the brain.

    "content": "Central to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis are two hormones, insulin and glucagon, both produced by the pancreas and released into the bloodstream in response to changes in blood glucose.\n* Insulin is made by the beta-cells of the pancreas and released when blood glucose is high. It causes cells around the body to take up glucose from the blood, resulting in lowering blood glucose concentrations.\n* Glucagon is made by the alpha-cells of the pancreas and released when blood glucose is low. It causes glycogen in the liver to break down, releasing glucose into the blood, resulting in raising blood glucose concentrations. (Remember that glycogen is the storage form of glucose in animals.)\nThe image below depicts a mouse islet of Langerhans, a cluster of endocrine cells in the pancreas. The beta-cells of the islet produce insulin, and the alpha-cells produce glucagon.\nFigure 4.14. A mouse islet of Langerhans, visualized with immunofluorescent microscopy. In this image, cell nuclei are stained blue, insulin is stained red, and blood vessels are stained green. You can see that this islet is packed with insulin and sits right next to a blood vessel, so that it can secrete the two hormones, insulin and glucagon, into the blood. Glucagon is not stained in this image, but it\u2019s there! \nIn the figure below, you can see blood glucose and insulin throughout a 24-hour period, including three meals. You can see that when glucose rises, it is followed immediately by a rise in insulin, and glucose soon drops again. The figure also shows the difference between consuming a sucrose-rich food and a starch-rich food. The sucrose-rich food results in a greater spike in both glucose and insulin. Because more insulin is required to handle that spike, it also causes a more precipitous decline in blood glucose. This is why eating a lot of sugar all at once may increase energy in the short-term, but soon after may make you feel like taking a nap!\nFigure 4.15. Typical pattern of blood glucose and insulin during a 24-hour period, showing peaks for each of 3 meals and highlighting the effects of consumption of sugar-rich foods.\nLet\u2019s look a little closer at how insulin works, illustrated in the figure below. Insulin is released by the pancreas into the bloodstream. Cells around the body have receptors for insulin on their cell membranes. Insulin fits into its receptors (labeled as step 1 in Figure 4.16), kind of like a key in a lock, and through a series of reactions (step 2), triggers glucose transporters to open on the surface of the cell (step 3). Now glucose can enter the cell, making it available for the cell to use and at the same time lowering the concentration of glucose in the blood.\nFigure 4.16. Insulin binds to its receptors on the cell membrane, triggering GLUT-4 glucose transporters to open on the membrane. This allows glucose to enter the cell, where it can be used in several ways. \nThe figure also shows several different ways glucose can be used once it enters the cell.\n* If the cell needs energy right away, it can metabolize glucose through cellular respiration, producing ATP (step 5).\n* If the cell doesn\u2019t need energy right away, glucose can be converted to other forms for storage. If it\u2019s a liver or muscle cell, it can be converted to glycogen (step 4). Alternatively, it can be converted to fat and stored in that form (step 6).\nIn addition to its role in glucose uptake into cells, insulin also stimulates glycogen and fat synthesis as described above. It also stimulates protein synthesis. You can think of its role as signaling to the body that there\u2019s lots of energy around, and it\u2019s time to use it and store it in other forms.\nOn the other hand, when blood glucose falls, several things happen to restore homeostasis.\n1. You receive messages from your brain and nervous system that you should eat.\n2. Glucagon is released from the pancreas into the bloodstream.",

Glucose, a 6-carbon molecule, is broken down to two 3-carbon molecules called pyruvate through a process called glycolysis.\n2. Pyruvate enters a mitochondrion of the cell, where it is converted to a molecule called acetyl CoA.\n3. Acetyl CoA goes through a series of reactions called the Krebs cycle. This cycle requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. It also produces several important high energy electron carriers called NADH2 and FADH2.\n4. These high energy electron carriers go through the electron transport chain to produce ATP\u2014energy for the cell!\n5.

    "content": "We\u2019ve already talked about what happens when blood glucose falls: glucagon is released, and that stimulates the breakdown of glycogen as well as the process of gluconeogenesis from amino acids. These are important mechanisms for maintaining blood glucose levels to fuel the brain when carbohydrate is limited. Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) can cause you to feel confused, shaky, and irritable, because your brain doesn\u2019t have enough glucose. If it persists, it can cause seizures and eventually coma, so it\u2019s good we have these normal mechanisms to maintain blood glucose homeostasis!\nWhat happens if your carbohydrate supply is limited for a long time? This might happen if a person is fasting, starving, or consuming a very low carbohydrate diet. In this case, your glycogen supplies will become depleted within about 24 hours. How will you get enough glucose (especially for the brain) and energy? You\u2019ll have to use the other two macronutrients in the following ways:\n1. Protein:\u00a0You\u2019ll continue to use some amino acids to make glucose through gluconeogenesis and others as a source of energy through acetyl CoA. However, if a person is starving, they also won\u2019t have extra dietary protein. Therefore, they start breaking down body proteins, which will cause muscle wasting.\n2. Fat:\u00a0You can break down fat as a source of energy, but you can\u2019t use it to make glucose. Fatty acids can be broken down to acetyl CoA in the liver, but acetyl CoA can\u2019t be converted to pyruvate and go through gluconeogenesis. It can go through the Krebs cycle to produce ATP, but if carbohydrate is limited, the Krebs cycle gets overwhelmed. In this case, acetyl CoA is converted to compounds called ketones or ketone bodies. These can then be exported to other cells in the body, especially brain and muscle cells.\nThese pathways are shown in the figure below:\nFigure 4.18. During starvation or when consuming a low-carbohydrate diet, protein (amino acids) can be used to make glucose by gluconeogenesis, and fats can be used to make ketones in the liver. The brain can adapt to using ketones as an energy source in order to conserve protein and prevent muscle wasting. \nKetone production is important, because ketones can be used by tissues of the body as a source of energy during starvation or a low carbohydrate diet. Even the brain can adapt to using ketones as a source of fuel after about three days of starvation or very low-carbohydrate diet. This also helps to preserve the protein in the muscle.\nKetones can be excreted in urine, but if ketone production is very high, they begin to accumulate in the blood, a condition called ketosis. Symptoms of ketosis include sweet-smelling breath, dry mouth, and reduced appetite. People consuming a very low carbohydrate diet may be in ketosis, and in fact, this is a goal of the currently popular ketogenic diet. (Ketones are acidic, so severe ketosis can cause the blood to become too acidic, a condition called ketoacidosis. This mainly happens with uncontrolled diabetes.)\nIs following a ketogenic diet an effective way to lose weight? It can be, but the same can be said of any diet that severely restricts the types of foods that you\u2019re allowed to eat. Following a ketogenic diet means eating a high fat diet with very little carbohydrate and moderate protein. This means eating lots of meat, fish, eggs, cheese, butter, oils, and low carbohydrate vegetables, and eliminating grain products, beans, and even fruit. With so many fewer choices, you\u2019re likely to spend more time planning meals and less time mindlessly snacking. Being in ketosis also seems to reduce appetite, and it causes you to lose a lot of water weight initially. However, studies show that being in ketosis doesn\u2019t seem to increase fat-burning or metabolic rate. There are also concerns that the high levels of saturated fat in most ketogenic diets could increase risk of heart disease in the long term.",

Without the beta-cells, you can\u2019t make enough insulin, so in type 1 diabetes, you simply don\u2019t have enough insulin to regulate your blood glucose levels. Remember how we said insulin is like the key that lets glucose into the body\u2019s cells? In type 1 diabetes, you\u2019re missing the key, so glucose stays in the blood and can\u2019t get into cells.\nFigure 4.19. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make enough insulin, so glucose transporters (GLUT-4) do not open on the cell membrane, and glucose is stuck outside the cell. \nCommon symptoms include weight loss and fatigue, because the body\u2019s cells are starved of glucose. Excess glucose from the blood is also excreted in the urine, increasing urination and thirst.\nOnce diagnosed, type 1 diabetics have to take insulin in order to regulate their blood glucose. Traditionally, this has required insulin injections timed with meals. New devices like continuous glucose monitors and automatic insulin pumps can track glucose levels and provide the right amount of insulin, making managing type 1 diabetes a little easier. Figuring out the right amount of insulin is important, because chronically elevated blood glucose levels can cause damage to tissues around the body. However, too much insulin will cause hypoglycemia, which can be very dangerous.\nType 1 diabetes is most commonly diagnosed in childhood, but it has been known to develop at any age.

It\u2019s as if you still have the insulin key but can\u2019t find the keyhole to unlock the doors and let the glucose in.\nFigure 4.20. In type 2 diabetes, the cell does not respond appropriately to insulin, so glucose is stuck outside the cell. \nThe result is the same: high blood glucose. At this point, you may be diagnosed with a condition called prediabetes. The pancreas tries to compensate by making more insulin, but over time, it becomes exhausted and eventually produces less insulin, leading to full-blown type 2 diabetes. According to the CDC, 100 million Americans are living with diabetes (30.3 million) or prediabetes (84.1 million).\nAlthough people of all shapes and sizes can get type 2 diabetes, it is strongly associated with abdominal obesity. In the past, it was mainly diagnosed in older adults, but it is becoming more and more common in children and adolescents as well, as obesity has increased in all age groups. In the maps below, you can see that as obesity has increased in states around the country, so has diabetes.\nFigure 4.21. Data from the CDC show the increasingly prevalence of both obesity and type 2 diabetes between 1994 and 2015. \nThe complications of type 2 diabetes result from long-term exposure to high blood glucose, or hyperglycemia. This causes damage to the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes, and nerves, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and nerve dysfunction.

Whole plant foods contain a mix of both soluble and insoluble fiber, but some are better sources of one than the other.\n1. Soluble Fiber\u00a0\u2013 These fibers dissolve in water, forming a viscous gel in the GI tract, which helps to slow digestion and the absorption of glucose. This means that including soluble fiber in a meal helps to prevent sharp blood sugar spikes, instead making for a more gradual rise in blood glucose. Consuming a diet high in soluble fiber can also help to lower blood cholesterol levels, because soluble fiber binds cholesterol and bile acids (which contain cholesterol) in the GI tract. Soluble fiber is also highly fermentable, so it is easily digested by bacteria in the large intestine. Pectins and gums are common types of soluble fibers, and good food sources include oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. (Psyllium fiber supplements like Metamucil are composed mainly of soluble fiber, so if you\u2019ve ever stirred a spoonful of this into a glass of water, you\u2019ve seen the viscous consistency characteristic of soluble fiber.)\n2. Insoluble Fiber \u2013 These fibers typically do not dissolve in water and are nonviscous. Some are fermentable by bacteria in the large intestine but to a lesser degree than soluble fibers.

Since fiber provides a bulkier stool, this helps keeps the digestive tract muscles toned and strong which can help prevent hemorrhoids and diverticula.\n* Lowers risk of cardiovascular disease. Higher fiber intake has been shown to improve blood lipids by reducing total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low density cholesterol (\u201cbad cholesterol,\u201d associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease), and increasing high density cholesterol (\u201cgood cholesterol,\u201d associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease). Higher fiber intake has also been associated with lower blood pressure and reduced inflammation.\n* Lowers risk of type 2 Diabetes. Higher fiber intake (especially viscous, or soluble fibers) has been shown to slow down glucose digestion and absorption, benefiting glucose metabolism. A higher fiber diet may also decrease diabetes risk by reducing inflammation.\n* Lowers risk of colorectal cancer. More evidence is supporting the idea that higher fiber intake lowers the risk of colorectal cancer, although researchers aren\u2019t sure why. One hypothesis is that dietary fiber decreases transit time (the time it takes for food to move through the digestive tract), thereby exposing the cells of the gastrointestinal tract to carcinogens from food for a shorter time.\n* Helps maintain a healthy body weight. Research has shown a relationship between higher dietary fiber intake and lower body weight. The mechanisms for this are unclear, but perhaps high-fiber foods are more filling and therefore keep people satisfied longer with fewer calories. High-fiber foods also tend to be more nutrient-dense compared to many processed foods, which are more energy-dense.",

    "content": "Before they are harvested, all grains are whole grains. They contain the entire seed (or kernel) of the plant. This seed is made up of three edible parts: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm. The seed is also covered by an inedible husk that protects the seed.\nFigure 4.24. Wheat growing in a field.\n1. The bran\u00a0is the outer skin of the seed. It contains antioxidants, B vitamins and fiber.\n2. The endosperm\u00a0is by far the largest part of the seed and provides energy in the form of starch to support reproduction. It also contains protein and small amounts of vitamins and minerals.\n3. The germ\u00a0is the embryo of the seed\u2014the part that can sprout into a new plant. It contains B vitamins, protein, minerals like zinc and magnesium, and healthy fats.\nFigure 4.25. The anatomy of a wheat kernel which \nincludes the bran, endosperm, and germ.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans define whole grains and refined grains in the following way:\nWhole Grains\u2014Grains and grain products made from the entire grain seed, usually called the kernel, which consists of the bran, germ, and endosperm. If the kernel has been cracked, crushed, or flaked, it must retain the same relative proportions of bran, germ, and endosperm as the original grain in order to be called whole grain. Many, but not all, whole grains are also sources of dietary fiber.\u201d\nWhole grains include foods like barley, corn (whole cornmeal and popcorn), oats (including oatmeal), rye, and wheat. (For a more complete list of whole grains, check out the Whole Grain Council.)\nRefined Grains\u2014Grains and grain products with the bran and germ removed; any grain product that is not a whole-grain product. Many refined grains are low in fiber but enriched with thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and iron, and fortified with folic acid.\u201d\nRefined grains include foods like white rice and white flour. According to the Whole Grain Council, \u201cRe\ufb01ning a grain removes about a quarter of the protein in a grain, and half to two thirds or more of a score of nutrients, leaving the grain a mere shadow of its original self.\u201d\nRefined grains are often enriched with vitamins and minerals, meaning that some of the nutrients lost during the refining process are added back in after processing. However, many vitamins and minerals are not added back, and neither are the fiber, protein, and healthy fats found in whole grains. In the chart below you can see the differences in essential nutrients between whole wheat flour, refined wheat flour, and enriched wheat flour.\nFigure 4.26. The nutrient content of refined wheat and enriched wheat as compared to whole wheat flour.\nBecause whole grains offer greater nutrient density, MyPlate and the Dietary Guidelines recommend that at least half of our grains are whole grains. Yet current data show that while most Americans are eating enough grains overall, they\u2019re eating too many refined grains and not enough whole grains, as shown in this graphic from the Dietary Guidelines:\nFigure 4.27. Average Whole & Refined Grain Intakes in Ounce-Equivalents per Day by Age-Sex Groups, Compared to Ranges of Recommended Daily Intake for Whole Grains & Limits for Refined Grains.\nLooking for whole grain products at the grocery store can be tricky, since the front-of-package labeling is about marketing and selling products. Words like \u201cmade with whole grain\u201d and \u201cmultigrain\u201d on the front of the package make it appear like a product is whole grain, when in fact there may be very few whole grains present.\nThe color of a bread can be deceiving too. Refined grain products can have added caramel color to make them appear more like whole grains.\nTo determine if a product is a good source of whole grain, the best place to look is the ingredient list on the Nutrition Facts panel.",

    "content": "The ingredients should list a whole grain as the first ingredient (e.g., 100% whole wheat), and it should not be followed by a bunch of refined grains such as enriched wheat flour.\nGetting familiar with the name of whole grains will help you identify them. Common varieties include wheat, barley, brown rice, buckwheat, corn, rye, oats, and wild rice. Less known varieties include teff, amaranth, millet, quinoa, black rice, black barley, and spelt.\nMost, but not all, whole grains are a good source of fiber, and that is one of the benefits of choosing whole grains. Keep in mind that some products add extra fiber as a separate ingredient, like wheat bran, inulin, or cellulose. These boost the grams of fiber on the Nutrition Facts label and may make the product a good source of fiber, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good source of whole grains. In fact, it may be a product made mostly of refined grains, so it would still be missing the other nutrients that come packaged in whole grains and may not have the same health benefits. Therefore, just looking at fiber on the Nutrition Facts label is not a good indicator of whether or not the product is made with whole grains.\nAlso, some products that are 100% whole wheat but do not appear to be a good source of fiber, because the serving size is small. The bread label below is an example of this. The first ingredient is \u201cstone ground whole wheat flour\u201d with no refined flours listed, but it still has only 2g of fiber and 9% DV. But of course, that still contributes to your fiber intake for the day, and if you made yourself a sandwich with two slices of bread, that would provide 18% of the DV.\nFigure 4.28.

    "content": "As we\u2019ve already discussed, sugars are naturally found in fruits, veggies, and dairy. These are nutrient dense foods that come packaged with other essential nutrients too.\nFigure 4.29. Examples of food that contain naturally occurring sugars: fruit, vegetables, and dairy.\nFresh fruits and veggies contain naturally-occurring sugars\u00a0like glucose, fructose, and sucrose, but also come packaged with fiber, potassium, and Vitamin C. Dairy foods like unsweetened yogurt, milk, and cheese contain naturally-occurring lactose but also come packaged with calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and riboflavin.\nAnother food that contains natural sugar in the form of maltose is sprouted grain bread. In the example below, the only ingredients are sprouted organic rye kernels and water, yet there are 7 grams of sugar per slice. This sugar must be naturally-occurring maltose, and as you can imagine, it comes packaged with nutrients like fiber, protein, and iron.\nFigure 4.30. An example of a sprouted wheat bread that contains naturally occuring maltose from sprouted rye kernels. \nIn contrast, added sugars\u00a0are concentrated sweeteners that are added as ingredients to foods to make them sweeter. They add calories to a food but contribute little to no essential nutrients, so they decrease the nutrient density of foods. Among the most common sources of added sugar are table sugar (sucrose) and high fructose corn syrup, but they come in many different forms with different names. For example, honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, and brown rice syrup may all sound more wholesome and natural, but they\u2019re still added sugars, because they are concentrated sweeteners that contribute little to no other nutrients. Other names for added sugar you might not recognize as sweeteners at all, like barley malt or treacle. Here\u2019s a list of 61 different names for added sugars:\nFigure 4.31. Names of sugar commonly added to food. \nWe find added sugars in some expected places, like cookies, ice cream, and soda, but there can also be a surprising amount of added sugar in yogurt, breakfast cereals, energy bars, and plant-based milk alternatives, like soy milk. We also find added sugars hiding in unexpected places, like ketchup, salad dressings, bread, and pasta sauce. In fact, nearly 75% of packaged products in the U.S. food supply are now sweetened.\nIn general, most people don\u2019t need to worry much about how much naturally-occurring sugar they consume. This goes back to the fact that naturally-occurring sugars are packaged with other nutrients. For example, a large apple contains about 23 grams of sugar, more than half of it in the form of fructose.1\u00a0However, it also has more than 5 grams of fiber, plus a significant amount of vitamin C and potassium. The fiber slows down the digestion and absorption of the sugar into your bloodstream, giving your body more time to metabolize it and giving you a greater feeling of fullness.\nA single can of soda, on the other hand, contains about 33 grams of sugar.1\u00a0It\u2019s in a similar chemical form as the sugar in the apple\u2014a mix of fructose and glucose\u2014but it\u2019s not accompanied by any fiber to slow down digestion. Therefore, it\u2019s rapidly absorbed into your bloodstream, and your body has to quickly metabolize the fructose to glucose and increase insulin secretion to process the spike in sugar. Plus, although the soda contains 150 calories and the apple has just 116, the apple is probably going to leave you feeling more satisfied and less hungry compared with the soda.\nFor all of these reasons, it\u2019s the added sugars that we worry about, not the naturally-occurring ones. That said, there is room for some added sugar in a balanced diet, and you can use it to make nutrient-dense food tastier. For example, you can drizzle honey into plain yogurt or sprinkle some brown sugar on roasted winter squash. You get far more nutritional \u201cbang for your buck\u201d using added sugars in this way than consuming them in something like a soda.",

Average intakes of added sugars as a percent of calories per day by age-sex group, in comparison to the Dietary Guidelines\u2019 maximum limit of less than 10 percent of calories.\nWhere are all of these added sugars coming from? Nearly half of them come from soda, juices, and other sugary drinks, as illustrated below. Therefore, the Dietary Guidelines recommend that people drink more water and less sugary drinks.\nFigure 4.33. Food category sources of added sugars in the U.S. population ages 2 years and older. \nOn the Nutrition Facts panel, sugar is expressed in grams, but most of us don\u2019t think in grams. Therefore, it can be helpful to convert gram amounts to teaspoons, which are easier to visualize. Use the conversions shown in the graphic below to make these calculations.\nFigure 4.34. \u00a0One teaspoon is equal to 4 grams of sugar or a sugar cube. \nThe sugar in soda adds up fast, especially with our super sized portions. For example, a 64-ounce soda has 186 grams of sugar, or about 46 teaspoons. (186 grams divided by 4g/tsp = 46 teaspoons.)\nFigure 4.35. Forty six sugar cubes stacked next to a big gulp to illustrate the 46 teaspoons of sugar that the soda contains.\nIt can be eye-opening to track your added sugar intake for a few days, and this may give you an idea of sources of added sugar that you can live without and replace with something else.

The reasons are complex, and this is an ongoing area of research and controversy. One possible explanation is that a diet high in added sugar means the pancreas has to work hard to make enough insulin, and over time, it can begin to fail and the body\u2019s cells start to become insulin resistant. The liver also has to work hard to metabolize fructose, and too much fructose increases fat synthesis, which can raise blood lipid and cholesterol levels, increasing risk of heart disease.\nBoth dietary sucrose and starch are associated with tooth decay. Bacteria living in the mouth can utilize the carbohydrates passing through the oral cavity for their own benefit. Those bacteria happily metabolize carbohydrates, especially sucrose, but also starchy foods, which stick to teeth and linger there. Acid is formed in the process, and this can dissolve your tooth enamel, eventually causing cavities, also known as dental caries. Reducing sugar intake, limiting between-meal snacks, and brushing after meals to remove lingering carbohydrates can help reduce the risk of dental caries. The use of fluoride and regular dental care also help.\nFig. 4.36. Dental caries are formed because of a combination of factors: the presence of oral bacteria; a supply of sugar and/or starch for them to eat; tooth surface where they can form colonies, or plaque; and time.",

    "content": "Students often ask which sugar is healthiest: high fructose corn syrup, honey, agave syrup, or sugar? In general, as far as the body is concerned, sugar is sugar. These are all concentrated sweeteners that contain calories with very few/no other nutrients, so all should be used only in moderation.\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has gotten a lot of attention in the last several decades and has been blamed for the obesity epidemic and many other poor health outcomes. This is in part because it\u2019s widely used to sweeten soda and so has become a large part of the American diet. It\u2019s true that fructose is more work for the body to process, because it has to be converted to glucose. Here\u2019s what the website Sugar Science, written by researchers and scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, has to say about the difference between table sugar and high fructose corn syrup:\n\u201cTable sugar (sucrose), derived from sugar cane and beets, is made up of equal portions of two types of sugars. It\u2019s half (50%) glucose and half (50%) fructose. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is derived from corn syrups that have undergone enzymatic processing to convert some of their glucose into fructose to produce a desired sweetness. HFCS comes in different formulations, depending on the manufacturer. More common formulations contain 42% fructose or 55% percent, but some contain as much as 90%. Why should we care? First, because there is significant evidence that fructose is processed differently in the body than other sugars and can be toxic to the liver, just like alcohol. Second, because as a nation, we have been consuming more of our sugars in HFCS over time.\u201d\nBut focusing too much attention on fructose as the problem may risk missing the forest for the trees. Here\u2019s what Dr. Luc Tappy, a fructose researcher at University of Lausanne, had to say about the issue in an article on Vox.com:\n\u201cGiven the substantial consumption of fructose in our diet, mainly from sweetened beverages, sweet snacks, and cereal products with added sugar, and the fact that fructose is an entirely dispensable nutrient, it appears sound to limit consumption of sugar as part of any weight loss program and in individuals at high risk of developing metabolic diseases. There is no evidence, however, that fructose is the sole, or even the main factor in the development of these diseases, nor that it is deleterious to everybody, and public health initiatives should therefore broadly focus on the promotion of healthy lifestyles generally, with restriction of both sugar and saturated fat intakes, and consumption of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables rather than focusing exclusively on reduction of sugar intake.\u201d\nVideo: \u201cWhat\u2019s The Difference Between Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup?\u201d by Reactions, YouTube (March 23, 2015), 2:41 minutes.\nAre sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup, and molasses any better than more refined and processed sweeteners? Maybe. These sweeteners do contain minerals and antioxidants, so they may offer a slight edge in terms of nutrition. However, keep in mind that minerals and antioxidants are abundant in whole foods such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, and these obviously offer many other benefits. These sweeteners are still considered sources of added sugar and should be used in moderation. That said, each of them offers different delicious flavors, and honey has the added benefit that it can be purchased locally, so there are good reasons to turn towards these products when you want to add some sweetness to your food.",

    "content": "If you\u2019re trying to figure out if a food is high in added sugar and what ingredients are contributing the added sugar, there are two places you should look on the label. First, check the Nutrition Facts panel to see how many grams of added sugar are in one serving. Be aware that the \u201ctotal sugars\u201d on the label includes both added and naturally-occurring sugars. The ingredients list will identify the sources of added sugar, which may be listed as any of the 61 different names in the graphic high on this page.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some labels to practice identifying naturally occurring and added sugars in foods.\nBelow are labels from a 6-ounce serving of plain yogurt. There are 6 grams of total sugar and 0 grams of added sugar listed on the label. What ingredients contain naturally-occurring sugar?\nFigure 4.37. Plain yogurt with Nutrition Facts and ingredient list. \nThe ingredients include nonfat milk, maltodextrin (a food additive that is a polysaccharide), milk protein concentrate, vitamins, and bacteria. There are no sources of added sugar in the ingredient list and zero grams of added sugar shown in the Nutrition Facts, so the 6 grams of total sugars are from naturally\u2013occurring lactose in the milk.\nNext, look at the label below for a 6-ounce serving of sweetened strawberry yogurt. There are 28 grams of total sugar and 21 grams of added sugar listed on the label. What ingredients are contributing naturally-occurring and added sugar in this product?\nFigure 4.38. Strawberry yogurt with Nutrition Facts and ingredient list. \nTo answer this question, we again have to look at the ingredients list. Like the plain yogurt, the first ingredient is milk, but this strawberry yogurt also contains cane sugar and strawberries. Based on these ingredients, the added sugar comes from sucrose in cane sugar,and the naturally-occurring sugar is from the lactose from the milk and the glucose, fructose, and sucrose in the strawberries.\nNot all yogurts are created equal, and many of them have less ingredients and less sugar than the example given above with the Greek yogurt. One example is siggi\u2019s Icelandic style skyr. As you can see in the images below, the ingredients are simple, and there is a lot less sugar than traditional yogurts.\nFigure 4.39. Siggi\u2019s strawberry yogurt and Nutrition Facts. \nIn the siggi\u2019s strawberry yogurt, a 5.3 oz (150g) serving has 11 grams of total sugar and 7 grams of added sugar. This is a combination of naturally-occurring sugar from the milk and strawberries and added sugar from the cane sugar. However, this product only has 7 grams of added sugar (just under 2 teaspoons), which is a lot less than the strawberry Greek yogurt with 21 grams of added sugar (just over 5 teaspoons) shown above.

Xylitol in particular has been studied for its ability to decrease the incidence of tooth decay. However, these studies generally use large doses. For example, a person might have to chew xylitol gum five times per day to see a benefit. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry supports the use of xylitol but says the evidence for benefit is not clear and that amounts required may not be practical in real life.4",

Observational studies that tracked large groups over years found that people who consumed sugar substitutes tended to have a higher BMI, greater weight and waist circumference, and a higher incidence of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular events.7 Because these are observational studies, we can\u2019t conclude that the sugar substitutes cause these health outcomes, but we can conclude that their use is not associated with better health.\nWhen it comes to weight management, the goal is to adopt eating habits that support a sustainable healthy body weight. Sugar substitutes might help in the short-term with decreasing calorie intake and perhaps gradually moving away from sweetened beverages, but better long-term goals for health would be to shift to water and other unsweetened beverages. If you\u2019re looking for a way to sweeten your oatmeal or yogurt, you might try adding fresh fruit rather than sugar or an artificial sweetener packet. (Or go ahead and add a bit of brown sugar or a drizzle of honey, keeping in mind the overall goal of moderation.)",

    "content": "Over the years, there have been a number of concerns about non-nutritive sweeteners. For example, in the 1970s, studies showed that saccharin was linked to bladder cancer in lab rats, so it was labeled as a potential carcinogen, although its use as a sweetener continued. In 2000, after many studies showed no link between cancer and saccharin, the warning labels were no longer required. Some studies have also raised concerns about a link between aspartame and sucralose and cancer, but the FDA has reviewed this evidence and concluded: \u201cBased on the available scientific evidence, the agency has concluded that the high-intensity sweeteners approved by FDA are safe for the general population under certain conditions of use.\u201d The National Cancer Institute also says there is no clear evidence that high intensity sweeteners cause cancer.8\nFigure 4.41. A \u201cSaccharin Notice\u201d sign warns consumers that a grocery store shelf contains products with saccharin, which has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Between 1977 and 2000, products containing saccharin had to include a cancer warning label. This requirement was removed after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined it was not a concern in humans at doses typically consumed. \nThere are other emerging safety concerns about sugar substitutes, though. Small studies on both mice and humans show that consuming artificial sweeteners can change our gut bacteria and cause glucose intolerance.9-11 Glucose intolerance means that blood glucose is abnormally elevated, showing that glucose metabolism is not working properly, and it is a precursor to the development of diabetes. Other researchers worry that having the taste of sweetness signaled to the brain without accompanying calories could derail our normal pathways for sensing hunger and satiety and for regulating glucose metabolism.12 This research is alarming but still preliminary. However, it is an active area of study, and we can expect more information to emerge in the years to come.",

    "content": "When you think of foods important to the Pacific Northwest, salmon may first come to mind. But to many indigenous people who have long made their home along the Pacific coast, a smaller, humbler fish is considered even more vital: the eulachon smelt.\nTraditionally, one of the first signs of spring in the region was the migration of the eulachon smelt into the region\u2019s rivers. These thin, blue and silver fish spend most of their lives in the cold Pacific Ocean, but when it\u2019s time for them to lay their eggs in early spring, they swim up into the rivers of Oregon, Washington, Canada, and Alaska to sow the seeds of their next generation.\nFor indigenous people living in this region, who historically subsisted through long winters on stored and preserved foods, the arrival of the eulachon smelt would have been a welcome infusion of calories and flavor. Legends describe the small oily fish saving entire villages from starvation; it\u2019s also known as \u201chalimotkw,\u201d translated as \u201csavior fish\u201d or \u201csalvation fish.\u201d\nFigure 5.1. Fresh-caught eulachon smelt from the Kuskokwim River, Alaska, 2008.\nBeyond the timing of its late winter arrival, what makes the eulachon so valuable is its high lipid content. It\u2019s so oily that dried eulachon will ignite and burn like a candle, and nutritionally, it\u2019s a dense source of calories. (Remember: Fat contains 9 kilocalories per gram compared to just 4 for carbohydrate and protein.) It\u2019s also a good source of fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin A, and high in omega-3 fatty acids. William Clark (of the Lewis and Clark expedition), after tasting eulachon from the Columbia River in 1805, wrote: \u201cThey are so fat they require no additional sauce, and I think them superior to any fish I ever taste[d], even more delicate and luscious than the white fish of the lakes which have heretofore formed my standard of excellence among the fishes.\u201d\nClark may have been the first person of European descent to document the eulachon, but it had long been valued by indigenous people, including members of the Tsimshian, Tlingit, Haida, Nisga\u2019s, and Bella Coola tribes. The eulachon run was an annual community event, and people camped for several weeks at the mouths of rivers to net and process the fish. They smoked eulachon to preserve it, but even more importantly, they fermented it in large batches and then cooked it to extract its oils. Once cooled, the fat was solid at room temperature\u2014similar to lard or butter\u2014and could be used for fat and flavor in cooking for the year ahead. It was so valuable that it was traded hundreds of miles inland, forming the great \u201cgrease trials\u201d of the Northwest.\nVIDEO: \u201cWatch a Fish Transform From Animal to Candle,\u201d by National Geographic (July 10, 2015), 2 minutes.\nFigure 5.2 (left): A page from William Clark\u2019s journal of 1805, describing his observations of the euchalon smelt, including its \u201cdelicate and luscious\u201d taste.

Taylor, entitled \u201cA Tsimshian Family Making Eulachon Butter,\u201d circa 1825, with this description: \u201cThe glow of the ember fire is on the girls face as she waits for stones to heat. In the box at the right, fish are being boiled by means of the heated stones: the oil thus removed from the fish forms \u201cbutter.\u201d The residue is being strained by the woman at the left.\u201d \nThese traditional uses of the eulachon continue on a smaller scale, but since the 1990s, the eulachon population has collapsed. Researchers say its biggest threat is climate change, and eulachon have been classified as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act since 2010.\nIn today\u2019s world\u2014when we can obtain a day\u2019s worth of calories and more than enough fat with just a quick trip through a fast food drive-through\u2014it\u2019s easy to forget the biological and cultural importance of lipids.",

As discussed in the Carbohydrates unit, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of energy, it is quite bulky with heavy water content, so the body cannot store much of it for long. Fats, on the other hand, can serve as a larger and more long-term energy reserve. Fats pack together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with energy, containing more than double the amount of energy as a gram of carbohydrate.\nWe draw on the energy stored in fat to help meet our basic energy needs when we\u2019re at rest and to fuel our muscles for movement throughout the day, from walking to class, playing with our kids, dancing through dinner prep, or powering through a shift at work. Historically, when humans relied on hunting and gathering wild foods or on the success of agricultural crops, having the ability to store energy as fat was vital to survival through lean times. Hunger remains a problem for people around the world, and being able to store energy when times are good can help them endure a period of food insecurity. In other cases, the energy stored in adipose tissue might allow a person to weather a long illness.\nUnlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost indefinitely in size. An overabundance of adipose tissue can be detrimental to your health not only from mechanical stress on the body due to excess weight, but also from hormonal and metabolic changes. Obesity can increase the risk for many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and certain types of cancer. It can also interfere with reproduction, cognitive function, and mood. Thus, while some body fat is critical to our survival and good health, in large quantities it can be a deterrent to maintaining good health.\nFigure 5.3.

When fatty foods are swallowed, the body responds by enabling the processes controlling digestion to slow the movement of food along the digestive tract, giving fats more time to be digested and absorbed and promoting an overall sense of fullness. Sometimes, before the feeling of fullness arrives, people overindulge in fat-rich foods, finding the delectable taste irresistible.

More than 95 percent of lipids in the diet are in the form of triglycerides, some having a visible presence and some hidden in foods. Concentrated fats (butter and vegetable oil, for example) and marbling of fat in meat are obviously visible. But fat can also be hidden in foods, as in baked goods, dairy products like milk and cheese, and fried foods. Naturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including avocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides in our food \u201cfats\u201d and \u201coils.\u201d Fats are lipids that are solid at room temperature, whereas oils are liquid. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are often used interchangeably. In this unit, when we use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.\nFigure 5.5. 95% of fats in the diet are in the form of triglycerides. Sterols (like cholesterol) make up about 3% of dietary fat intake and phospholipids make up roughly 2% of dietary fat intake.\nThe structure of a triglyceride is made up of glycerol and three fatty acids. Glycerol is the three-carbon backbone of triglycerides, while fatty acids are longer chains of carbon molecules attached to the glycerol backbone. The \u201cglyceride\u201d in the word \u201ctriglyceride\u201d refers to this glycerol backbone, while the \u201ctri\u201d refers to the fact that there are three fatty acids attached. Fatty acids are called acids because they have an acid group (\u2212COOH) on one end of a carbon chain. A monoglyceride contains glycerol with one fatty acid attached, and a diglyceride contains glycerol with two fatty acids attached.\nFigure 5.6. The chemical structure of a triglyceride, showing the glycerol backbone and three attached fatty acids.\nFigure 5.7. The structure of a triglyceride is often depicted as a simplified drawing of the glycerol backbone and three fatty acids.\nThere are different types of fatty acids, and triglycerides can contain a mixture of them. Fatty acids are classified by their carbon chain length and degree of saturation.

    "content": "Phospholipids are found in both plants and animals but make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids. However, they play many important roles in the body and in foods. Phospholipids can also be synthesized by the body, so they don\u2019t have to be consumed in the diet.\nPhospholipids are similar in structure to triglycerides (Figure 5.8). Like triglycerides, phospholipids have a glycerol backbone. But unlike triglycerides, phospholipids only have two fatty acid molecules attached to the glycerol backbone, while the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bonded to a phosphate group\u2014a chemical group that contains the mineral phosphorus.\nFigure. 5.8. The structural difference between a triglyceride (on the left) and a phospholipid (on the right) is in the third carbon position, where the phospholipid contains a phosphate group instead of a fatty acid. \nThe unique structure of phospholipids makes them both fat- and water-soluble, or amphiphilic. The fatty acids are hydrophobic (dislike water), and the phosphate group and glycerol are hydrophilic (attracted to water).\nFigure 5.9. A phospholipid molecule consists of a polar phosphate \u201chead,\u201d which is hydrophilic, and a non-polar lipid \u201ctail,\u201d which is hydrophobic. \nThe amphiphilic nature of phospholipids makes them very useful for several functions in the body. Every cell in the body is encased in a membrane composed primarily of a double layer of phospholipids (also known as the phospholipid bilayer), which protects the inside of the cell from the outside environment while at the same time allowing for transport of fat and water through the membrane. Phospholipids also play a role in transporting fats in the blood, as we\u2019ll learn later in this unit.\nFigure 5.10. The phospholipid bilayer consists of two adjacent sheets of phospholipids, arranged tail to tail. The hydrophobic tails associate with one another, forming the interior of the membrane. The polar heads contact the fluid inside and outside of the cell.\nAnother important role of phospholipids is to act as emulsifiers. Emulsions are mixtures of two liquids that do not normally mix (oil and water, for example). Without an emulsifier, the oil and water separate out into two layers. Because of their ability to mix with both water and fat, phospholipids are ideal emulsifiers that can keep oil and water mixed, dispersing tiny oil droplets throughout the water. Lecithin\u2014a phospholipid found in egg yolk, soybean, and wheat germ\u2014is often used as a food emulsifier. Emulsifiers also play an important role in making food appetizing; their inclusion in foods like sauces and creams makes for a smoother texture and prevents the oil and water ingredients from separating out. They also can extend shelf life.\nVIDEO: \u201cWhat are Emulsions?,\u201d by FuseSchool \u2013 Global Education, YouTube (May 26, 2013), 3:07 minutes.

Most sterols do not contain any fatty acids but rather are multi-ring structures, similar to chicken wire. They are complex molecules that contain interlinking rings of carbon atoms, with side chains of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen attached.\nCholesterol is the best-known sterol because of its role in heart disease. It forms a large part of the fatty plaques that narrow arteries and obstruct blood flow in atherosclerosis. However, cholesterol also has many essential functions in the body. Like phospholipids, cholesterol is present in all body cells as it is an important substance in cell membrane structure. Cholesterol is also used in the body as a precursor in the synthesis of a number of important substances, including vitamin D, bile, and sex hormones such as progesterone, testosterone, and estrogens.\nFigure 5.11. Cholesterol is made up of multiple carbon rings bonded together.\nCholesterol is not an essential nutrient; it does not need to be consumed in the diet, because it is manufactured in the liver. Only foods that come from animal sources contain cholesterol. Cholesterol is found in foods like meat, poultry, fish, egg yolks, butter, and dairy products made from whole milk.\nPlant foods do not contain cholesterol, but sterols found in plants resemble cholesterol in structure. Plant sterols inhibit cholesterol absorption in the human body, which can contribute to lower cholesterol levels, particularly lower LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol levels.

In a saturated fatty acid, each carbon is bonded to two hydrogen atoms, with single bonds between the carbons.\nAlternatively, fatty acids can have points where hydrogen atoms are missing, because there is a double bond between carbons (C=C). This is referred to as a point of unsaturation, because the carbon is only bonded to one hydrogen atom instead of two. Unsaturated fatty acids have one or more points of unsaturation, or double bonds between the carbons. A monounsaturated fatty acid is a fatty acid with one double bond, and a polyunsaturated fatty acid is a fatty acid with two or more double bonds.\nFigure 5.12. The structures of a saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat. Note the differences in points of unsaturation (C=C double bonds) on some of the fatty acids.\nTriglycerides in food contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, but some foods are better sources of these types of fatty acids than others (Figure 5.13). For example, coconut oil is very high in saturated fat, but it still contains some monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Peanut oil is often thought of as a good source of monounsaturated fat, because that is the predominant fatty acid in the oil, but peanut oil also contains a fair amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids and even some saturated fatty acids.\nFigure 5.13.

This is because the lack of double bonds in the carbon chains of saturated fatty acids makes them very straight, so they pack together well (like a box of toothpicks). Fats that have mostly saturated fatty acids, like butter and coconut oil, are solid at room temperature, as are the visible fat layers in a strip of bacon or a cut of beef. Consuming a diet high in saturated fats is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, because such a diet increases blood cholesterol, specifically the LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol level.

    "content": "In addition to the length of the carbon chain and the number of double bonds, unsaturated fatty acids are also classified by the position of the first double bond relative to the methyl (-CH3) or \u201comega\u201d end of the carbon chain (the end furthest from the glycerol backbone in a triglyceride). Fatty acids with the first double bond at the third carbon from the omega end are called omega-3 fatty acids. Those with the first double bond at the sixth carbon from the omega end are called omega-6 fatty acids. (There are also omega-9 fatty acids.)\nFigure 5.17. The position of the first C=C double bond determines whether an unsaturated fatty acid is classified as omega-3 or omega-6. The two essential fatty acids, linoleic acid (an omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3) are shown here.\nFatty acids are vital for the normal operation of all body systems, but the body is capable of synthesizing most of the fatty acids it needs. However, there are two fatty acids that the body cannot synthesize: linoleic acid (an omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, an omega-3). These are called essential fatty acids because they must be consumed in the diet. Other fatty acids are called nonessential fatty acids, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re unimportant; the classification is based solely on the ability of the body to synthesize the fatty acid. Excellent food sources of linoleic fatty acid include plant oils such as corn oil and soybean oil, often found in salad dressings and margarine. Rich food sources of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) include nuts, flaxseed, whole grains, legumes, and dark green leafy vegetables.\nFigure 5.18. The chemical structure of the essential fatty acids shown in shorthand, without individual carbon and hydrogen atoms marked.\nMost Americans easily consume enough linoleic acid and other omega-6 fatty acids, because corn and soybean oil are common ingredients in our food supply. However, sources of ALA and other omega-3 fatty acids are less common in the American diet, and many people could benefit from incorporating more sources of these into their diet. As an added benefit, whole foods rich in ALA come packaged with other healthful nutrients, like fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.\nA true essential fatty acid deficiency is rare in the developed world, but it can occur, usually in people who eat very low-fat diets or have impaired fat absorption. Symptoms include dry and scaly skin, poor wound healing, increased vulnerability to infections, and impaired growth in infants and children.1\nOmega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are precursors to a large family of important signaling molecules called eicosanoids  (prostaglandins are one type of eicosanoid). Among the many functions of eicosanoids in the body, one of the most important is to regulate inflammation. Without these hormone-like molecules, the body would not be able to heal wounds or fight off infections each time a foreign germ presented itself. In addition to their role in the body\u2019s immune and inflammatory processes, eicosanoids also help to regulate circulation, respiration, and muscle movement.\nEicosanoids derived from omega-6 fatty acids tend to increase blood pressure, blood clotting, immune response, and inflammation. These are necessary functions, but they can be associated with disease when chronically elevated. In contrast, eicosanoids derived from omega-3 fatty acids tend to lower blood pressure, inflammation, and blood clotting, functions that can benefit heart health. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids compete for the same enzymatic pathways in the formation of different eicosanoids, so increasing omega-3 fatty acids in the diet may have anti-inflammatory effects.\nTwo additional omega-3 fatty acids with important health benefits are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).",

They also promote normal growth and development in infants, especially in the development of the brain and eyes. Both of these important omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized in the body from ALA, so they are not considered essential fatty acids. However, the rate of conversion of ALA to these omega-3s is limited, so it is beneficial to consume them regularly in the diet. Fish, shellfish, fish oils, seaweed, and algae are all good sources of EPA and DHA. DHA is also found in human breast milk in quantities dependent on the mother\u2019s own intake of DHA sources.\nFigure 5.19. EPA and DHA are important but non-essential omega-3 fatty acids that can be made in the body from ALA. \nFish oil and omega-3 supplements are among the most commonly used dietary supplements in the United States. Researchers have hypothesized that these supplements might decrease risk of cardiovascular disease, be helpful for those with rheumatoid arthritis, and improve infant brain development when taken in pregnancy or in infancy. Some studies have found such benefits of the supplements, but others haven\u2019t. One reason for these inconsistent results may be that studies often don\u2019t measure participants\u2019 baseline omega-3 levels and intake from foods, and those already consuming adequate omega-3s are less likely to benefit from a supplement. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming 8 ounces of a variety of seafood each week, and in general, people who meet this recommendation likely consume enough omega-3 fatty acids already (along with the other healthful nutrients found in fish) and are unlikely to see an added benefit of taking a fish oil supplement. Some doctors may recommend that people at risk of cardiovascular disease take a fish oil or omega-3 supplement, especially if they don\u2019t eat fish regularly.2.",

    "content": "The carbon-carbon double bond in an unsaturated fatty acid chain can result in different shapes depending on whether the fatty acid is in a cis or trans configuration. When the hydrogen atoms are bonded to the same side of the carbon chain, it is called a cis fatty acid. Because the hydrogen atoms are on the same side (and repelling one another), the carbon chain has a bent structure. Naturally-occurring fatty acids usually have a cis configuration.\nIn a trans fatty acid, the hydrogen atoms are bonded on opposite sides of the carbon chain, resulting in a more linear structure. Unlike cis fatty acids, most trans fatty acids are not found naturally in foods, but instead are a result of an industrial process called hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen to the carbon-carbon double bonds, thus making the fatty acid saturated (or less unsaturated, in the case of partial hydrogenation).\nHydrogenation creates both saturated and trans fatty acids. Trans fatty acids are actually unsaturated fatty acids, but they have the linear shape of saturated fatty acids. (The carbon chains are not bent like naturally-occurring unsaturated fats.) The trans fatty acids formed through partial hydrogenation have an unusual shape, which makes their properties and actions in the body similar to saturated fatty acids.\nFigure 5.20. Comparison of a saturated fatty acid to both the cis and trans forms of an unsaturated fatty acid.\nHydrogenation was developed in order to make oils semi-solid at room temperature, enabling production of spreadable margarine and shortening from inexpensive ingredients like corn oil. Hydrogenation also makes oils more stable and less likely to go rancid, so partially hydrogenated oils were favored by fast food restaurants for frying, and manufacturers of processed baked goods like cookies and chips found they gave their products a longer shelf life. And because trans fats are unsaturated, nutrition scientists and the medical community believed that they were a healthier alternative to saturated fats.\nBut around the 1990s, evidence that trans fats were not healthy\u2014far worse than saturated fats, in fact\u2014began to accumulate. Like saturated fat, trans fats increase LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol, but they also have the effect of decreasing HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol and of increasing inflammatory processes in the body. Researchers found that consuming trans fats, even at low levels (1 to 3 percent of total energy intake), was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. They estimated that eliminating industrial trans fats from the food supply might prevent as many as 19 percent of heart attacks in the U.S. at the time, coming to 228,000 heart attacks averted.3\nIn 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring food companies to list trans fat information on the Nutrition Facts panel of food labels to keep consumers informed of their intake of these fats. That prompted the food industry to mostly eliminate partially hydrogenated oils from their products, often substituting palm oil and coconut oil in their place (both of which are high in saturated fat and may promote heart disease). In 2013, the FDA determined that trans fats were no longer considered safe in the food supply, and in 2015, the agency issued a ruling requiring that manufactured trans fats no longer be included in the U.S. food supply. A one-year extension was granted in 2018, and foods produced prior to that date were given time to work through the food supply. The final ruling requires all manufactured trans fats to be eliminated from the U.S. food supply by 2021.4",

From there, the products of lipid digestion are absorbed into circulation and transported around the body, which again requires some special handling since lipids are not water-soluble and do not mix with the watery blood.\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning to learn more about the path of lipids through the digestive tract.",

Bile, which is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is released into the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine. Bile salts have both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic side, so they are attracted to both fats and water. This makes them effective emulsifiers, meaning that they break large fat globules into smaller droplets. Emulsification makes lipids more accessible to digestive enzymes by increasing the surface area for them to act (see Fig. 5.22 below).\nThe pancreas secretes pancreatic lipases into the small intestine to enzymatically digest triglycerides. Triglycerides are broken down to fatty acids, monoglycerides (glycerol backbone with one fatty acid still attached), and some free glycerol. Cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins do not need to be enzymatically digested (see Fig. 5.22 below).\nVIDEO: \u201cBile and Emulsification\u201d by Fuse School \u2013 Global Education, YouTube (May 26, 2020), 3:35 minutes.",

Again, bile helps with this process. Bile salts cluster around the products of fat digestion to form structures called micelles, which help the fats get close enough to the microvilli of intestinal cells so that they can be absorbed. The products of fat digestion diffuse across the membrane of the intestinal cells, and bile salts are recycled back to do more work emulsifying fat and forming micelles.\nFigure 5.22. Lipid digestion and absorption in the small intestine.\nOnce inside the intestinal cell, short- and medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream, but larger lipids such as long-chain fatty acids, monoglycerides, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol need help with absorption and transport to the bloodstream. Long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides reassemble into triglycerides within the intestinal cell, and along with cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, are then incorporated into transport vehicles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large structures with a core of triglycerides and cholesterol and an outer membrane made up of phospholipids, interspersed with proteins (called apolipoproteins) and cholesterol. This outer membrane makes them water-soluble so that they can travel in the aqueous environment of the body. Chylomicrons from the small intestine travel first into lymph vessels, which then deliver them to the bloodstream.\nChylomicrons are one type of lipoprotein\u2014transport vehicles for lipids in blood and lymph.

Whether breastfed or formula-fed, fat provides about half of an infant\u2019s calories, and it serves an important role in brain development. Yet, infants are born with low levels of bile and pancreatic enzyme secretion, which are essential contributors to lipid digestion in older children and adults. So, how do babies digest all of the fat in their diet?\nInfants have a few special adaptations that allow them to digest fat effectively. First, they have plenty of lingual and gastric lipases right from birth. These enzymes play a much more important role in infants than they do in adults. Second, breast milk actually contains lipase enzymes that are activated in the baby\u2019s small intestine. In other words, the mother makes lipases and sends them in breast milk to help her baby digest the milk fats. Amazing, right? Between increased activity of lingual and gastric lipases and the lipases contained in breast milk, young infants can efficiently digest fat and reap its nutritional value for growth and brain development. Studies show that fat digestion is more efficient in premature infants fed breast milk compared with those fed formula. Even pasteurized breast milk, as is used when breast milk is donated for feeding babies in the hospital, is a little harder to digest, because heat denatures the lipases. (Infants can still digest pasteurized breast milk and formula; they\u2019re just less efficient at doing so and absorb less of the products of triglyceride digestion.)1",

However, all are made up of the same four basic components: cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and proteins.\nThe interior of a lipoprotein\u2014called the lipid core\u2014carries the triglycerides and cholesterol esters, both of which are insoluble in water. Cholesterol esters are cholesterol molecules with a fatty acid attached. The exterior of lipoproteins\u2014called the surface coat\u2014is made up of components that are at least partially soluble in water: proteins (called apolipoproteins), phospholipids, and unesterified cholesterol. The phospholipids are oriented so that their water-soluble heads are pointed to the exterior, and their fat-soluble tails are pointed towards the interior of the lipoprotein. Apoliproteins are similarly amphipathic (soluble in both fat and water), a property that makes them useful for aiding in the transport of lipids in the blood.\nFigure 5.24. Basic structure of all lipoproteins. Note the orientation of phospholipids on the surface coat. \nWhile all lipoproteins have this same basic structure and contain the same four components, different types of lipoproteins vary in the relative amounts of the four components, in their overall size, and in their functions. These are summarized in the graph and table below, and the following sections give more details on the role of each type of lipoprotein.\nFigure 5.25.

A more appropriate descriptor for LDL might be the \u201cbad cholesterol transporter.\u201d We can think of HDL as the \u201cgood cholesterol transporter,\u201d although the more researchers learn about HDL, the more they realize that this is also an oversimplification.\nWhat\u2019s so bad about LDL? If there\u2019s too much LDL in the blood, it can become lodged in arterial walls and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, when fatty plaques thicken the walls of arteries and reduce the flow of blood (and therefore oxygen and nutrients). Atherosclerosis can lead to a number of problems, including the following:\n* coronary artery disease (can lead to angina and heart attack)\n* carotid artery disease (increases risk of stroke)\n* peripheral artery disease\n* chronic kidney disease\nIf a broken piece of plaque or a blood clot completely blocks an artery supplying the brain or the heart, it can cause a stroke or a heart attack, respectively. If you have high LDL cholesterol, then making changes like exercising more, eating less saturated fat, and stopping smoking (if applicable) can help lower it. Sometimes medications are also necessary to keep LDL in check.\nFig. 5.28. Atherosclerosis. (a) Atherosclerosis can result from plaques formed by the buildup of fatty, calcified deposits in an artery. (b) Plaques can also take other forms, as shown in this micrograph of a coronary artery that has a buildup of connective tissue within the artery wall. LM \u00d7 40. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School \u00a9 2012)\nPhysicians sometimes run additional blood tests to measure the LDL particle size and the number of LDL particles. The standard LDL test measures the total amount of cholesterol that is carried by LDL, but the reality is that LDL comes in a range of sizes, and small LDL particles are more strongly associated with the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease than large LDL particles. For two people with the same total LDL cholesterol measurement, a person with more small particles will have a greater number of LDL particles circulating and a higher risk of developing heart disease. A person with more large LDL particles will have fewer particles overall and a lower risk of developing heart disease. Measuring particle size is not recommended for all patients because of the cost of the test and the fact that it rarely changes treatment course or improves outcomes. However, it can be useful in patients with diabetes or insulin resistance, as they tend to have more small LDL particles, which may call for using medications sooner or in higher doses.\nHDL has been considered the \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d or \u201cgood cholesterol transporter\u201d because it scavenges cholesterol, including LDL lodged in the arterial walls, and helps to remove it from the body. Previously, it was thought that high HDL could prevent atherosclerosis and protect people from cardiovascular disease.",

Pharmaceutical companies developed drugs to raise HDL, thinking this would help to prevent cardiovascular disease. When these medications were tested in clinical trials, they were effective at raising HDL, but they didn\u2019t decrease the incidence of heart attack, stroke, angina, or death from cardiovascular disease.1 In one clinical trial, the incidence of cardiovascular events and death from any cause were actually increased in people who took the HDL-raising medication (2). Genetic studies have also shown that people with genes for higher HDL don\u2019t necessarily have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease.3 People with low HDL cholesterol do seem to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, but they also tend to have other risk factors like sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and diabetes. It\u2019s not clear that low HDL is actually a cause of cardiovascular disease; we only know that it\u2019s correlated. Because of these discoveries, raising HDL cholesterol is no longer considered a goal of prevention of heart disease. Rather, lowering LDL cholesterol is the primary target.4,5.",

The burden of cardiovascular disease makes it critical to address dietary and lifestyle choices that can decrease risk factors for these diseases. According to the American Heart Association, the following risk factors for heart disease are modifiable, meaning they can be managed or changed by the individual:\n* high blood pressure\n* high blood cholesterol\n* tobacco use\n* diabetes\n* poor diet\n* physical inactivity\n* overweight or obesity\nIn light of these risk factors, there are many dietary strategies related to fat intake that can reduce the risk of heart disease.

    "content": "Being conscious of the need to reduce blood cholesterol levels to improve health often means limiting the consumption of saturated fats. Multiple studies have shown an association between the saturated fats found in some meat, whole-fat dairy products, butter, and tropical oils (coconut and palm oils) and higher LDL cholesterol levels. However, while saturated fats have a historical reputation for being unhealthy, more recent research has suggested that the link between saturated fat and heart disease may not be as clear cut as we once thought.\nThe BMJ\u2019s analysis on dietary fat and heart health explains the complicated relationship as such:\n> \u201cSynergism and interactions between different components of foods together with the degree of processing and preparation or cooking methods lead to a \u2018food matrix\u2019 effect which is not captured by considering single nutrients. Different types of food that are high in saturated fats are likely to have different effects on health. For example, dairy products and processed meats, both high in saturated fats, are differentially associated with many health outcomes in prospective epidemiological studies, often in opposite directions. One explanation for this divergence is that despite their similar fat content, other components of these two food groups are associated with different health effects. For example, dairy products contain minerals such as calcium and magnesium and have probiotic features if fermented, whereas processed red meat has a high salt and preservative content.\n> \n> \n> To produce public health guidelines on which foods to eat or avoid to reduce the risk of chronic disease is complicated because dietary fats are typically mixtures of different types of fatty acids. Animal fats, for instance, are the main sources of saturated fats in many modern diets, but some animal fats are higher in monounsaturated fats than saturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils will typically contain both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in different concentrations. Hence, conclusions about the health effects of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are unlikely to consistently translate to the health effects of the fats, oils, and foods in which those fatty acids are present.\u201d\nIn an article from Tufts University Health & Nutrition Letter, Links Between Saturated Fat, Blood Cholesterol & Heart Disease Prove Complex, researcher Ronald M. Krauss, MD, said, \u201cthere is insufficient evidence from prospective epidemiological studies to conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\u201d Researchers state that reducing saturated fat intake may not clearly decrease CVD risk in part because people tend to replace saturated fat with processed carbohydrates. Recent studies have attempted to tease out different approaches to lowering saturated fat in the diet, showing that the types of foods used to replace saturated fat affect the risk of heart disease.\n* If saturated fat in the diet is replaced with unsaturated fats, risk for heart disease decreases.\n* If saturated fat in the diet is replaced with refined carbohydrates, risk for heart disease increases.\nThe 2015 DGA report described the evidence as follows:\n> \u201cStrong and consistent evidence shows that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, is associated with reduced blood levels of total cholesterol and of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Additionally, strong and consistent evidence shows that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats is associated with a reduced risk of CVD events (heart attacks) and CVD-related deaths.\n> \n> \n> Some evidence has shown that replacing saturated fats with plant sources of monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil and nuts, may be associated with a reduced risk of CVD.",

Evidence has also shown that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates reduces blood levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, but increases blood levels of triglycerides and reduces high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol). Replacing total fat or saturated fats with carbohydrates is not associated with reduced risk of CVD. Additional research is needed to determine whether this relationship is consistent across categories of carbohydrates (e.g., whole versus refined grains; intrinsic versus added sugars), as they may have different associations with various health outcomes. Therefore, saturated fats in the diet should be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.\u201d\nDr. Krauss summed up the recommendations as such: \u201cAn overall eating pattern that emphasizes whole grains rather than refined carbs such as white flour, along with foods high in polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, seeds, nuts and vegetable oils, is of more value for reducing coronary heart disease risk than simply aiming to further reduce saturated fat.\u201d\nFigure 5.29.

Substitute oils for solid fats when possible.\n* Choose whole-grain and high-fiber foods. Reduced risk for cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol absorption.

There are 20 different amino acids, and we require all of them to make the many different proteins found throughout the body. Proteins are crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life.\nJust like carbohydrates and fats, proteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but proteins are the only macronutrient that also contain nitrogen as part of their core structure. In each amino acid, the elements are arranged into a specific conformation, consisting of a central carbon bound to the following four components:\n* A hydrogen\n* A nitrogen-containing amino group\n* A carboxylic acid group (hence the name \u201camino acid\u201d)\n* A side chain\nThe first three of those components are the same for all amino acids. The side chain\u2014represented by an \u201cR\u201d in the diagram below\u2014is what makes each amino acid unique.\nFigure 6.1. Amino Acid Structure.\nAmino acid side chains vary tremendously in their size and can be as simple as one hydrogen (as in glycine, shown in Figure 6.1) or as complex as multiple carbon rings (as in tryptophan). They also differ in their chemical properties, thus impacting the way amino acids act in their environment and with other molecules. Because of their side chains, some amino acids are polar, making them hydrophilic and water-soluble, whereas others are nonpolar, making them hydrophobic or water-repelling. Some amino acids carry a negative charge and are acidic, while others carry a positive charge and are basic. Some carry no charge. Some examples are given below. For this class, you don\u2019t need to memorize amino acid structures or names, but you should appreciate the diversity of amino acids and understand that it is the side chain that makes each different.\nFigure 6.2.

Proteins are similar to carbohydrates and lipids in that they are polymers (simple repeating units); however, proteins are much more structurally complex. In contrast to carbohydrates, which have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids that are different from one another. Different proteins are produced because there are 20 types of naturally occurring amino acids that are combined in unique sequences.\nAdditionally, proteins come in many different sizes. The hormone insulin, which regulates blood glucose, is composed of only 51 amino acids. On the other hand, collagen, a protein that acts like glue between cells, consists of more than 1,000 amino acids. Titin is the largest known protein. It accounts for the elasticity of muscles and consists of more than 25,000 amino acids!\nThe huge diversity of proteins is also due to the unending number of amino acid sequences that can be formed.

All of the music that exists in the world has been derived from a basic set of seven notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B (with the addition of sharps and flats), and there is a vast array of music all composed of specific sequences from these basic musical notes.

Overview of protein synthesis. Protein folding happens after translation.\n1. Transcription \u2013 Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the long, double-stranded molecules containing your genome\u2014instructions for making all of the proteins in your body. In the nucleus of the cell, the DNA must be transcribed or copied into the single-stranded messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which carries the genetic instructions into the cell\u2019s cytosol for protein synthesis.\n2. Translation \u2013 At the ribosomes in the cell\u2019s cytosol, amino acids are linked together in the specific order dictated by the mRNA. Each amino acid is connected to the next amino acid by a special chemical bond called a peptide bond (Figure 6.4). The peptide bond forms between the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing a molecule of water. As amino acids are linked sequentially by peptide bonds, following the specific order dictated by the mRNA, the protein chain, also known as a polypeptide chain, is built (Figure 6.5).\nFigure 6.4.

Primary structure \u2013 This is the one-dimensional polypeptide chain of amino acids, held together by peptide bonds.\n2. Secondary structure \u2013 The polypeptide chain folds into simple coils (also called helices) and sheets, determined by the chemical interactions between amino acids.\n3. Tertiary structure \u2013 This is the unique three-dimensional shape of a protein, formed as the different side chains of amino acids chemically interact, either repelling or attracting each other. Thus, the sequence of amino acids in a protein directs the protein to fold into a specific, organized shape.\n4. Quaternary structure \u2013 In some proteins, multiple folded polypeptides called subunits combine to make one larger functional protein. This is called quaternary protein structure. The protein hemoglobin is an example of a protein that has quaternary structure. It is composed of four polypeptides that bond together to form a functional oxygen carrier.\nFigure 6.6.

Large fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible. Because digestion of some fibrous proteins is incomplete, not all of the amino acids are absorbed and available for the body to utilize, thereby decreasing their nutritional value.\nThe specific three-dimensional structure of proteins can be disrupted by changes in their physical environment, causing them to unfold. This is called denaturation, and it results in loss of both structure and function of proteins. Changes in pH (acidic or basic conditions) and exposure to heavy metals, alcohol, and heat can all cause protein denaturation. The proteins in cooked foods are at least partially denatured from the heat of cooking, and denaturation in the stomach is an important part of protein digestion, as we\u2019ll discuss later in this unit. We can see everyday examples of denaturation in cooking techniques, like how egg whites become solid and opaque with cooking, and cream becomes fluffy when it\u2019s whipped. Both of these are examples of denaturation leading to physical changes in protein structure, and because protein structure determines function, denaturation also causes proteins to lose their function.\nVIDEO: \u201cHeat Changes Protein Structure,\u201d by Sumanas (2006), 1:22 minutes.

As you can imagine, consuming a diet that is deficient in protein and essential amino acids can impair many of the body\u2019s functions. (More on that later in the unit.)\nFigure 6.9. Examples of proteins with different functions, sizes, and shapes.\nMajor types and functions of proteins are summarized in the table below, and the subsequent sections of this page give more detail on each of them.\n| Protein Types and Functions | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type | Examples | Functions |\n| Structure | Actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, keratin | Give tissues (bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, muscles) strength and structure |\n| Enzymes | Amylase, lipase, pepsin, lactase | Digest macronutrients into smaller monomers that can be absorbed; performs steps in metabolic pathways to allow for nutrient utilization |\n| Hormones | Insulin, glucagon, thyroxine | Chemical messengers that travel in blood and coordinate processes around the body |\n| Fluid and acid-base balance | Albumin, hemoglobin | Maintains appropriate balance of fluids and pH in different body compartments |\n| Transport | Hemoglobin, albumin, protein channels, carrier proteins | Carry substances around the body in the blood or lymph; help molecules cross cell membranes |\n| Defense | Collagen, lysozyme, antibodies | Protect the body from foreign pathogens |\n|  |  |  |\nTable 6.2.

    "content": "More than one hundred different structural proteins have been discovered in the human body, but the most abundant by far is collagen, which makes up about 6 percent of total body weight. Collagen makes up 30 percent of bone tissue and comprises large amounts of tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, and muscle. Collagen is a strong, fibrous protein made up of mostly glycine and proline amino acids. Within its quaternary structure, three protein strands twist around each other like a rope and then these collagen ropes overlap with others.\nFigure 6.10. Triple-helix structure of collagen\nThis highly ordered structure is even stronger than steel fibers of the same size. Collagen makes bones strong but flexible. Collagen fibers in the skin\u2019s dermis provide it with structure, and the accompanying elastin protein fibrils make it flexible. Pinch the skin on your hand and then let go; the collagen and elastin proteins in skin allow it to go back to its original shape. Smooth-muscle cells that secrete collagen and elastin proteins surround blood vessels, providing the vessels with structure and the ability to stretch back after blood is pumped through them. Another strong, fibrous protein is keratin, an important component of skin, hair, and nails.",

An enzyme\u2019s job is to provide a site for a chemical reaction and to lower the amount of energy and time it takes for that chemical reaction to happen (this is known as \u201ccatalysis\u201d). On average, more than 100 chemical reactions occur in cells every single second, and most of them require enzymes. The liver alone contains over 1,000 enzyme systems. Enzymes are specific and will use only particular substrates that fit into their active site, similar to the way a lock can be opened only with a specific key. Fortunately, an enzyme can fulfill its role as a catalyst over and over again, although eventually it is destroyed and rebuilt. All bodily functions, including the breakdown of nutrients in the stomach and small intestine, the transformation of nutrients into molecules a cell can use, and building all macromolecules, including protein itself, involve enzymes.\nFigure 6.11.

The hormone is then transported in the blood to its target cell, where it communicates a message to initiate a specific reaction or cellular process. For instance, after you eat a meal, your blood glucose levels rise. In response to the increased blood glucose, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. Insulin tells the cells of the body that glucose is available and to take it up from the blood and store it or use it for making energy or building macromolecules. A major function of hormones is to turn enzymes on and off, so some proteins can even regulate the actions of other proteins. While not all hormones are made from proteins, many of them are.",

    "content": "Adequate protein intake enables the basic biological processes of the body to maintain homeostasis (constant or stable conditions) in a changing environment. One aspect of this is fluid balance, keeping water distributed properly in the different compartments of the body. If too much water suddenly moves from the blood into a tissue, the results are swelling and, potentially, cell death. Water always flows from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. As a result, water moves toward areas that have higher concentrations of other solutes, such as proteins and glucose. To keep the water evenly distributed between blood and cells, proteins continuously circulate at high concentrations in the blood. The most abundant protein in blood is the butterfly-shaped protein known as albumin. The presence of albumin in the blood makes the protein concentration in the blood similar to that in cells. Therefore, fluid exchange between the blood and cells is not in the extreme, but rather is minimized to preserve homeostasis.\nFigure 6.12. The butterfly-shaped protein, albumin, has many functions in the body including maintaining fluid and acid-base balance and transporting molecules.\nProtein is also essential in maintaining proper pH balance (the measure of how acidic or basic a substance is) in the blood. Blood pH is maintained between 7.35 and 7.45, which is slightly basic. Even a slight change in blood pH can affect body functions. The body has several systems that hold the blood pH within the normal range to prevent this from happening. One of these is the circulating albumin. Albumin is slightly acidic, and because it is negatively charged it balances the many positively charged molecules circulating in the blood, such as hydrogen protons (H+), calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Albumin acts as a buffer against abrupt changes in the concentrations of these molecules, thereby balancing blood pH and maintaining homeostasis. The protein hemoglobin also participates in acid-base balance by binding hydrogen protons.",

A cell\u2019s plasma membrane is usually not permeable to large polar molecules, so to get the required nutrients and molecules into the cell, many transport proteins exist in the cell membrane.

Alternatively, if a person is consuming a high protein diet and eating more calories than their body needs, the extra amino acids will be broken down and transformed into fat.

    "content": "The appropriate amount of protein in a person\u2019s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When amino acids are broken down, nitrogen is released. Most nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine, but some urea is also contained in feces. Nitrogen is also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore, is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to balance the amount of protein used by the body, measured as the amount of nitrogen lost from the body. The Institute Of Medicine used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein.\n* Nitrogen Balance\u2013 A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen consumed equals the amount of nitrogen excreted. Most healthy adults are in nitrogen balance. If more protein is consumed than needed, this extra protein is used for energy, and the nitrogen waste that results is excreted. The lowest amount of protein a person can consume and still remain in nitrogen balance represents that person\u2019s minimum protein requirement.\nFigure 6.14. People are in nitrogen balance when they excrete as much nitrogen as they consume.\n* Negative Nitrogen Balance\u2013 A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who is eating a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than they actually need.\nFigure 6.15. People are in negative nitrogen balance when they excrete more nitrogen than they consume, usually because they are not eating enough protein to meet their needs.\n* Positive Nitrogen Balance\u2013 A person is in positive nitrogen balance when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during pregnancy or growth in childhood. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.\nFigure 6.16. People are in positive nitrogen balance when they excrete less nitrogen than they consume, because they are using protein to actively build new tissue.",

Lower-quality incomplete proteins do not contain all nine essential amino acids in proportions needed to support growth and health. \nFoods that are complete protein sources include animal foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, poultry, and meat. A few plant foods also are complete proteins, such as soy (soybeans, soy milk, tofu, tempeh) and quinoa.\nMost plant-based foods are deficient in at least one essential amino acid and therefore are incomplete protein sources. For example, grains are usually deficient in the amino acid lysine, and legumes are low in methionine and tryptophan. Because grains and legumes are not deficient in the same amino acids, they can complement each other\n\u00a0in a diet. When consumed in tandem, they contain all nine essential amino acids at adequate levels, so they are called complementary proteins. Some examples of complementary protein foods are given in Table 6.4. Mutual supplementation\u00a0is another term used when combining two or more incomplete protein sources to make a complete protein. Complementary protein sources do not have to be consumed at the same time\u2014as long as they are consumed within the same day, you will meet your protein needs. Most people eat complementary proteins without thinking about it, because they go well together. Think of a peanut butter sandwich and beans and rice; these are examples of complementary proteins. So long as you eat a variety of foods, you don\u2019t need to worry much about incomplete protein foods.

The stomach releases gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate the chemical digestion of protein. Muscular contractions, called peristalsis, also aid in digestion. The powerful stomach contractions churn the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture, which is called chyme.\nFig. 6.18. Protein digestion in the stomach\nBecause of the hydrochloric acid in the stomach, it has a very low pH of 1.5-3.5. The acidity of the stomach causes food proteins to denature, unfolding their three-dimensional structure to reveal just the polypeptide chain. This is the first step of chemical digestion of proteins. Recall that the three-dimensional structure of a protein is essential to its function, so denaturation in the stomach also destroys protein function. (This is why a protein such as insulin can\u2019t be taken as an oral medication. Its function is destroyed in the digestive tract, first by denaturation and then further by enzymatic digestion. Instead, it has to be injected so that it is absorbed intact into the bloodstream.)\nFig. 6.19. In the stomach, proteins are denatured because of the acidity of hydrochloric acid.\nOnce proteins are denatured in the stomach, the peptide bonds linking amino acids together are more accessible for enzymatic digestion. That process is started by pepsin, an enzyme that is secreted by the cells that line the stomach and is activated by hydrochloric acid. Pepsin begins breaking peptide bonds, creating shorter polypeptides.\nFig. 6.20. Enzymatic digestion of proteins begins in the stomach with the action of the enzyme pepsin. \nProteins are large globular molecules, and their chemical breakdown requires time and mixing. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion. Eating a high-protein meal increases the amount of time required to sufficiently break down the meal in the stomach. Food remains in the stomach longer, making you feel full longer.",

The pancreas secretes digestive juices into the small intestine, and these contain more enzymes to further break down polypeptides.\nThe two major pancreatic enzymes that digest proteins in the small intestine are chymotrypsin and trypsin. Trypsin activates other protein-digesting enzymes called proteases, and together, these enzymes break proteins down to tripeptides, dipeptides, and individual amino acids. The cells that line the small intestine release additional enzymes that also contribute to the enzymatic digestion of polypeptides.\nTripeptides, dipeptides, and single amino acids enter the enterocytes of the small intestine using active transport systems, which require ATP. Once inside, the tripeptides and dipeptides are all broken down to single amino acids, which are absorbed into the bloodstream. There are several different types of transport systems to accommodate different types of amino acids. Amino acids with structural similarities end up competing to use these transporters. That\u2019s not a problem if your protein is coming from food, because it naturally contains a mix of amino acids. However, if you take high doses of amino acid supplements, those could theoretically interfere with absorption of other amino acids.\nFig. 6.21. Summary of protein digestion.

The nitrogen is initially released as ammonia, and because ammonia is toxic, the liver transforms it into urea. Urea is then transported to the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Urea is a molecule that contains two nitrogens and is highly soluble in water. This makes it ideal for transporting excess nitrogen out of the body.\nBecause amino acids are building blocks that the body reserves in order to synthesize other proteins, more than 90 percent of the protein ingested does not get broken down further than the amino acid monomers.",

    "content": "Although severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it is a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped countries. There are two main syndromes associated with protein deficiencies: Kwashiorkor and Marasmus.\nKwashiorkor affects millions of children worldwide. When it was first described in 1935, more than 90 percent of children with Kwashiorkor died. Although the associated mortality is slightly lower now, most children still die after the initiation of treatment.\nThe name Kwashiorkor comes from a language in Ghana and means, \u201crejected one.\u201d The syndrome was named because it occurs most commonly in children recently weaned from breastfeeding, usually because the mother had a new baby, and the older child is switched to a diet of watery porridge made from low-protein grains. The child may be consuming enough calories, but not enough protein.\nKwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, poor growth, low muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of the roles of protein in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis of the protein albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues, causing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not only swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability. Severe protein deficiency in addition to other micronutrient deficiencies, such as folate, iodine, iron, and vitamin C all contribute to the many health manifestations of this syndrome.\nChildren and adults with marasmus are protein deficient, but at the same time, they\u2019re also not taking in enough calories. Body weights of children with marasmus may be up to 80 percent less than that of a healthy child of the same age. Marasmus is a Greek word meaning \u201cstarvation.\u201d The syndrome affects more than fifty million children under age five worldwide. It is characterized by an extreme emaciated appearance, poor skin health, poor growth, and increased risk of infection. The symptoms are acute fatigue, hunger, and diarrhea.\nFigure 6.23. The photo on the left shows a child suffering from kwashiorkor (note the swollen belly) in the late 1960s in a Nigerian relief camp during the Nigerian-Biafran War. The photo on the right shows an Indian child suffering from marasmus. \nKwashiorkor and marasmus often coexist as a combined syndrome termed marasmic kwashiorkor. Children with the combined syndrome have variable amounts of edema and the characterizations and symptoms of marasmus. Although organ system function is compromised by undernutrition, the ultimate cause of death is usually infection. Undernutrition is intricately linked with suppression of the immune system at multiple levels, so undernourished children commonly die from severe diarrhea and/or pneumonia resulting from bacterial or viral infection. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), nearly half of all deaths of children under age five are related to malnutrition.3 That translates to about 3 million child deaths each year.\nWhile severe protein deficiency is rare in the U.S., there are several groups at risk of low protein intake. A 2018 study found that 23 percent of U.S. adolescent girls (aged 14 to 18 years old) and 11 percent of adolescent boys were consuming below the RDA for protein, which may compromise their growth and development.2 This is thought to be related to the growing independence in food choices and the high prevalence of dieting in this group.\nLow protein intake is also a concern for the elderly in the U.S.",

Some researchers argue that older adults actually need more protein than recommended by the RDA in order to maintain muscle mass and function.4.",

    "content": "When the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine wrote the DRI for macronutrients, published in 2005, they concluded that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to establish an Upper Limit for protein. The high end of the AMDR, 35 percent of kilocalories for protein, was set in order to allow the total diet to be well-balanced with carbohydrate and fat.1 Higher levels of protein intake haven\u2019t been well-studied, but over the years, there have been many concerns with high protein diets. However, current evidence indicates it\u2019s large amounts of animal protein (particularly from red meat or processed meats) that can be problematic, not high amounts of protein per se.5\nFor example, a diet containing lots of steak, bacon, and sausage would be high in protein, but it also might be high in saturated fat, cholesterol, salt, and nitrates. Eating more red meat and processed red meat is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and cancer (especially colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and breast cancers). This link doesn\u2019t seem to be caused by the protein but rather the nutritional package that it comes in. In addition, the link to cancer may be related to the carcinogens that can form when meat is cooked at high temperatures, particularly when it\u2019s charred by grilling.5\nOn the other hand, studies show that when protein comes from lean meat and plant sources, risk of chronic diseases may be reduced. For example, a 2015 study found that frequent consumption of red meat in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer later in life, whereas consuming poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts instead lowered risk.6 Other studies have shown that higher protein diets can reduce the risk of heart disease, provided the protein comes from healthier sources.\nFig. 6.24. Compare several different \u201cprotein packages.\u201d The steak and bacon provide protein but also large amounts of saturated fat and sodium. Salmon provides as much protein as the steak but with less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fats. Lentils are a good source of protein, are low in fat, and are a great source of fiber. \nSeveral other concerns about high protein diets haven\u2019t turned out to be problematic after all:\n* Osteoporosis \u2013 High protein diets were once thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis, because researchers noticed that urinary calcium excretion increases when people consume high amounts of protein. However, a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis from the National Osteoporosis Foundation found that this is not a concern, and some studies even show that higher protein intake is associated with greater bone mineral density.7\n* Kidney function \u2013 Another concern was that high protein diets would strain the kidneys because of the increased need to filter and excrete nitrogen. A 2018 meta-analysis concluded that this is not a concern. However, people who already have chronic kidney disease should avoid high protein diets and maintain protein intake around the RDA of 0.8 g/kg, a lower intake than many Americans are consuming.8 A 2009 study tested a very low protein diet of 0.6 g/kg protein per day in people with chronic kidney disease and found that it did not prevent the development of kidney failure but did increase the risk of death, underscoring the importance of adequate protein even in people with kidney disease.9\nFrom all of this research, there\u2019s little evidence that a high protein diet is inherently harmful, so long as the protein doesn\u2019t come packaged with a lot of saturated fat and red meat consumption is limited. Still, there\u2019s little research directly testing the health effects of very high protein diets, including those achieved using protein supplements of purified protein, so it\u2019s probably wise to keep protein balanced with the other macronutrients, focusing on whole foods from all the food groups.",

Or maybe it came from an animal, one raised for its meat or to produce milk or eggs. We choose foods based on their taste, price, convenience, and nutritional value, but it\u2019s also worth considering their backstories. This is particularly true for protein foods, because animal protein production generally consumes more resources and is less sustainable than plant protein sources. Agricultural animals need care, feeding, housing, disposal of their waste, and sometimes medication use throughout their lives. It\u2019s worth considering where our protein comes from and how our choices affect the planet, especially since most of us consume more protein than we need.",

    "content": "The World Resources Institute, a global research non-profit organization with a mission \u201cto move human society to live in ways that protect Earth\u2019s environment\u201d has compiled data on the environmental impact of protein choices. In the graphic below, you\u2019ll see that in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, protein sources from plants have a much lower impact than protein sources from animals. Most plant proteins, with the exception of nuts, are also less expensive. Beef, lamb, and goat meat come at a higher cost to the environment and your wallet.\nFig. 6.25. Protein Scorecard from the World Resources Institute. Source: https://www.wri.org/resources/data-visualizations/protein-scorecard\nBeef is among the most resource-intensive sources of protein. A 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences calculated that beef production uses 28 times more land and 11 times more irrigation water than the average of dairy, poultry, pork, and egg production.1\nIt\u2019s important to point out that sustainable animal agriculture does fill some important roles that plants can\u2019t. For example, much of the world\u2019s pasture land is on steep terrain that wouldn\u2019t work well for growing food crops. And animal waste\u2014in the form of manure\u2014is an important fertilizer, including in organic food systems. So, animal agriculture and eating meat aren\u2019t inherently bad for the environment, but it would probably be good for the planet if we ate less meat, as shown in the graphic below.\nFig. 6.26. Shifting High Consumers\u2019 Diets Can Greatly Reduce Per Person Land Use and GHG Emissions from the World Resources Institute. Source: https://www.wri.org/resources/charts-graphs/animal-based-foods-are-more-resource-intensive-plant-based-foods\nIn terms of environmental impact, making small shifts can have a significant impact. Consider the following approaches2:\n* If you eat meat every day, try adding a \u201cmeatless Monday\u201d into your week and experiment with some vegetarian recipes. Once you\u2019ve adapted to that, try adding another day.\n* Replace some of your beef meals with dishes featuring chicken, pork, eggs, fish, or legumes.\n* Eat smaller portions of meat and add more plant foods to your plate. For example, if you enjoy spaghetti and meat sauce, try using less meat in your sauce and adding in vegetables like mushrooms, bell peppers, and carrots. Your meal will be more nutrient-dense and maybe even more flavorful.\nWhen you consider that moderate shifts like these would not only be good for the planet but also good for our health, then they don\u2019t seem like much of a sacrifice. A 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that just following standard dietary guidelines (which recommend a variety of protein sources, including plant proteins, and eating more whole grains, fruits and vegetables) could reduce mortality by 6 to 10 percent and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 29 to 70 percent.3,4\nThis page from the World Resources Institute provides more information: Sustainable Diets: What You Need to Know in 12 Charts, by Janet Ranganathan and Richard Waite, April 20, 2016.",

    "content": "One of the biggest current threats to public health is antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are life-saving drugs, but over time, bacteria can develop resistance to them. This means that the antibiotics no longer work to kill the bacteria causing infections, leaving people with more severe illnesses and fewer treatment options, often needing to try different antibiotics that have more side effects. There are now some bacterial infections for which we have no working antibiotics to treat them. According to the CDC, at least 2.8 million people are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year in the U.S, and these infections are thought to kill at least 35,000 people annually.5 Addressing this problem will require us to be more careful about how we use antibiotics, invest in research to develop new ones, and to develop other ways of preventing bacterial disease, such as new vaccines.\nAntibiotics are important to both human and animal medicine. When we\u2019re sick with a bacterial illness, we may need antibiotics to treat it, and the same is true of animals, whether they\u2019re raised for agriculture or part of our families as our pets. The problem is that the more we use antibiotics, the more chances bacteria have to evolve resistance to them, and the less effective those antibiotics become.\nFig. 6.27. Scanning electron micrograph of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, brown) surrounded by cellular debris. MRSA resists treatment with many antibiotics. Credit: NIAID\nVIDEO: \u201cWatch antibiotic resistance evolve\u201d by Science News, YouTube (September 8, 2016), 2:02 minutes. Watch how quickly bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics when they\u2019re exposed to them and how resistant populations can grow.\nThe overuse of antibiotics in both human medicine and animal agriculture has contributed to the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For example, taking antibiotics for an illness caused by a virus, such as the common cold or the flu, won\u2019t make you better and just gives harmful bacteria chances to evolve resistance. Historically, antibiotics were also routinely given to food production animals to make them fatter, and that allowed for the growth of antibiotic resistance. As of 2017, the FDA ruled that antibiotics can no longer be used for growth promotion in animal agriculture, a significant step in reducing the overuse of these drugs that are important to both humans and animals. Data released by the FDA in December 2018 show that antibiotic sales for farm animals have dropped significantly after this rules change.6\nAntibiotics can still be used to treat sick farm animals or stop the spread of disease, which is important for animal health and welfare. However, antibiotics can also be used to prevent disease in animals that might become sick. Many experts argue that allowing antibiotics to be used for disease prevention leaves a loophole for large amounts of antibiotics to continue to be used, especially in farming systems where animals are crowded and diseases can spread quickly. The World Health Organization has called for this practice to stop, reserving antibiotics only for use in animals that are already sick, not healthy animals. The goal is to reduce antibiotic use in order to reduce the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, so that we can still use these valuable medicines to treat sick animals and humans when needed.\nWhen antibiotics are used in food animals, bacteria can evolve resistance to those antibiotics. Those antibiotics-resistant bacteria can then be present in your meat, and they can spread in the environment from animal feces, including into the water used to irrigate fruits and vegetables. Humans exposed to these bacteria by handling or eating contaminated food can then become sick with infections that are resistant to antibiotic treatment, as shown in this infographic from the CDC:\nFig. 6.28.

This video explains the link between agriculture and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nWhat can you do to prevent yourself and your family from getting sick with antibiotic-resistant infections? The CDC offers these tips, most of which are useful for reducing your risk of foodborne illness in general:\n* Take antibiotics only when needed.\n* Follow simple Food Safety Tips:\n\t+ COOK. Use a food thermometer to ensure that foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature: 145\u00b0F for whole beef, pork, lamb, and veal (allowing the meat to rest for 3 minutes before carving or consuming), 160\u00b0F for ground meats, and 165\u00b0F for all poultry, including ground chicken and turkey.\n\t+ CLEAN. Wash your hands after touching raw meat, poultry, and seafood. Also wash your work surfaces, cutting boards, utensils, and grill before and after cooking.\n\t+ CHILL. Keep your refrigerator below 40\u00b0F and refrigerate foods within 2 hours of cooking (1 hour during the summer heat).\n\t+ SEPARATE. Germs from raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs can spread to produce and ready-to-eat foods unless you keep them separate. Use different cutting boards to prepare raw meats and any food that will be eaten without cooking.\n* Wash your hands after contact with poop, animals, or animal environments.\n* Report suspected outbreaks of illness from food to your local health department.\n* Review CDC\u2019s Traveler\u2019s Health recommendations when preparing to travel to a foreign country.\nWhen you shop for meat, milk, and eggs, you\u2019ll see lots of different types of labels making claims about how the animals were raised. Does any of this matter when it comes to antibiotic resistance? First, it\u2019s important to note that no animal products\u2014however they\u2019re labeled\u2014should ever contain antibiotics, as required by federal law. If an animal is treated with an antibiotic, it can\u2019t be sold for slaughter or have its milk sold until the antibiotic is cleared from its system. However, if animals were routinely treated with antibiotics earlier in their lives, those practices could have contributed to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.\nChoosing products that are certified organic ensures that antibiotics weren\u2019t used in their production, because organic farms are not allowed to use antibiotics even for sick animals.7 (If an animal becomes sick and requires antibiotic treatment to get better, its milk, meat, or eggs can no longer be sold as organic, but it can be sold to a conventional farm.)\nYou\u2019ll also see labels stating \u201craised without antibiotics,\u201d and buying these products helps to support farmers and companies that have committed to reducing antibiotic use in their production systems, even if they aren\u2019t certified organic. However, antibiotic resistant bacteria (bacteria that have evolved resistance to antibiotics so could cause hard-to-treat infections) may still be present in products that are labeled certified organic or \u201craised without antibiotics\u201d (the bacteria could have spread to these animals from somewhere else), so follow the food safety rules no matter where your meat comes from.8\nFigure 6.29. These eggs are certified organic, so you can be confident that antibiotics weren\u2019t used in their production. The sausage is not organic, but it is made from chickens raised without antibiotics, so its production is unlikely to have contributed to the problem of antibiotic resistance.\nMore and more companies are also recognizing how the overuse of antibiotics can contribute to antibiotic resistance, and they\u2019re changing their practices.",

From the charts at the top of this page, you can also see that fish are a relatively sustainable source of protein in terms of using little land and freshwater and producing low levels of greenhouse gases.\nHowever, the oceans have been overfished, and global supplies of wild-caught fish are dwindling. Aquaculture, or fish farming, has also created new environmental challenges. Both of these issues are being solved with good management, like careful limits on wild-caught fishing and new management practices for fish farming. You can encourage these practices by purchasing sustainably-sourced seafood.10 The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program can help with this. You can download their app to help with buying decisions in the grocery store and find more information on their website: Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.\nFig. 6.30.

Learn more about problems with fish sustainability and solutions by watching this video.\nYou may have also heard that fish can contain dangerous levels of mercury. This is true of some large species of fish that are higher up the food chain, because they accumulate mercury from their smaller prey and then we get a big dose when we eat them. Fish that have dangerous levels of mercury include king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish, and bigeye tuna. Pregnant women and growing children in particular should take care to avoid these types of fish, because mercury can interfere with brain development. However, the same groups also stand to benefit from healthful omega-3 fatty acids, like DHA and EPA, which are helpful for brain development. Thus, it\u2019s good for pregnant women and children to eat fish, so long as they avoid the ones with high levels of mercury. Most common types of fish have lower levels of mercury and can be eaten at least once per week, if not two or three times per week11.

    "content": "On December 26, 2018, 33-year-old Colin O\u2019Brady of Portland, Oregon, became the first person to cross the landmass of Antarctica solo, unassisted, and without any resupply shipments. Others had crossed the continent with the help of a wind sail to propel them over the ice or with resupply drops along the way\u2014both ways of saving precious energy\u2014but O\u2019Brady completed the 926-mile trek only on skis, pulling a sled packed with food, fuel, and supplies the entire way. Speed was important, because he was racing another man, Louis Rudd, a 49-year-old British Army captain. And of course, he didn\u2019t want to run out of food hundreds of miles from the finish. Rudd finished the Antarctica crossing just two days after O\u2019Brady.\nFigure 7.1. Endurance athlete Colin O\u2019Brady, photographed in March 2016.\nTo prepare for the expedition, O\u2019Brady and his team had to make careful calculations to estimate his nutrient and caloric needs. He\u2019d be skiing all day, every day in below zero temperatures and against constant wind for about two months. O\u2019Brady estimated that he\u2019d burn about 10,000 calories per day on his journey, and he knew that if he didn\u2019t pack enough food, he wouldn\u2019t have the strength to complete this epic test of endurance in extreme conditions. Previous explorers died in the Antarctic because they didn\u2019t pack enough food.\nFigure 7.2. O\u2019Brady and Rudd raced across a landscape similar to that shown in this photo from Antarctica\u2014a polar desert and the coldest, windiest, driest continent on earth.\nBut O\u2019Brady also knew that the more food he packed, the heavier his sled would be\u2014ironically making him burn more calories, plus slowing him down and prolonging his trip. So he focused on choosing foods that were calorie- and nutrient-dense but lightweight: oatmeal with added oil and protein powder; freeze-dried dinners reconstituted with melted snow; and 4,500-calorie slabs of a custom-made \u201cColin bar\u201d made from coconut oil, nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.\nAt the start of his journey, O\u2019Brady\u2019s sled weighed 375 pounds and contained enough food to provide him with 8,000 calories per day. That was a bit short of the 10,000 calories he estimated he\u2019d burn every day, so to build up some additional energy stores, he gained 15 pounds prior to his trip. In the end, after 54 days of skiing through ice and snow, he lost 25 pounds during his Antarctic crossing. He was successful, and while his fitness level and determination were surely critical to his feat, the trip would have been impossible without an adequate supply of calories.\nIn our daily lives, we need far fewer calories than an Antarctic adventurer, and we don\u2019t need to schlep a two-month supply of food on our backs wherever we go. Thankfully, we also get to enjoy fresher and more interesting food options. But each of us, every day, whether we\u2019re aware of it or not, is attempting to balance the calories we consume with the calories we burn, just like Colin O\u2019Brady. This is the concept of energy balance\u2014one we\u2019ll be exploring throughout this unit. If adults eat roughly the same number of calories as they burn each day, their body weight will generally stay very constant. If they burn more calories than they eat, like O\u2019Brady on his expedition, they\u2019ll lose weight. If they consume more calories than they burn, they\u2019ll gain weight.\nEnergy balance may seem like a simple concept, but in practice, how many calories a person eats and expends each day is influenced by so many different factors that it can be frustratingly difficult to apply. The human body has many sophisticated mechanisms that have evolved to help us protect and maintain our body weight, and in the history of our species, these mechanisms have been vital to our survival in times of food shortages. But today, we live in a world where highly palatable food is easily available and convenient, and we\u2019re constantly bombarded with marketing messages enticing us to eat more of it.",

    "content": "At the same time, the diet industry and media send messages saying that being thin is the same as being healthy and that restrictive dieting is the virtuous path to wellness, which ironically may cause weight gain and worsen people\u2019s mental and physical health. Meanwhile, disparities in access to healthy food, safe places for physical activity, and healthcare have grown, all of which are associated with body weight and health. Many other factors, including the use of some medications, exposure to certain chemicals in the food supply and environment, inadequate sleep, excess stress, microbiome changes, and experiencing traumatic events, have been linked to body weight.\nIn this unit, we\u2019ll explore these complex concepts and concerns and seek some answers, but we acknowledge that we raise more questions than we resolve. The truth is that researchers don\u2019t fully understand why body weight has increased over the last several decades, much less how to change this trend. What is clear is that body weight is extraordinarily complex, and people have long been harmed by oversimplified messages to \u201ceat less and move more\u201d to reach a \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d body weight. This approach implies that obesity is a failure of personal responsibility, but the last several decades have shown that blaming individuals for the size and shape of their bodies has not changed the trajectory of increasing body weight, and it has likely worsened people\u2019s health by harming their relationships with food and perpetuating weight stigma.\nWe have done our best to approach this topic with care, recognizing that it can be very personal. We know that the language used to describe people\u2019s bodies can be hurtful, and that encouraging people to engage in restrictive dieting practices for the purposes of making their bodies smaller can cause harm.

    "content": "Our body weight is influenced by our energy intake (calories we consume) and our energy output (energy we expend during rest and physical activity). This relationship is defined by the energy balance equation:\nEnergy Balance = energy intake \u2013 energy expenditure\nWhen an individual is in energy balance, energy intake equals energy expenditure, and weight should remain stable.\nPositive energy balance occurs when energy intake is greater than energy expenditure, usually resulting in weight gain.\nNegative energy balance is when energy intake is less than energy expenditure, usually resulting in weight loss.\nEnergy intake is made up of the calories we consume from food and beverages. These calories come from the macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and alcohol. Remember that when the body has a surplus of energy, this energy can be stored as fat. When the body has an inadequate supply of food calories to match energy expenditure, it will turn to stored energy (i.e., adipose tissue, glycogen, and some muscle protein) to meet energy demands, resulting in weight loss.\nYou may see simple rules about energy balance, such as the idea that a pound of fat contains 3,500 calories, so cutting 3,500 calories from your diet will result in a pound of weight loss. This is sometimes extrapolated to say that cutting your caloric intake by 500 calories per day will lead to one pound of weight loss per week, or 52 pounds of weight loss in one year. However, this is a myth, because the body responds to caloric restriction by making adjustments to energy expenditure and resisting changes in body weight, especially over long periods of time.1\nEnergy balance is complex, dynamic, and variable between individuals\u2014something we\u2019ll explore a bit more later on this page\u2014but it is still a vital concept in understanding body weight. Next, let\u2019s look at the energy expenditure side of the energy balance equation, to see the components that make up energy expenditure and the factors that influence them.",

Examples include:\n* respiration\n* circulation\n* nervous system activity\n* protein synthesis\n* temperature regulation\nBasal metabolic rate does not include the energy required for digestion or physical activity.\nBMR is usually the largest component of energy expenditure, making up about 60 to 75 percent of total energy output. For example, a sedentary person might need about 1800 calories in a day, with about 1200 of them being for BMR.\nFigure 7.4. Components of energy expenditure and their percent contribution to the total in sedentary to moderately active people.\u00a0\nBMR can vary widely among individuals. An individual\u2019s lean body mass\u2014made up of organs, bone, and muscle\u2014is the biggest determinant of BMR, because lean body tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue. This means that a muscular person expends more energy than a person of similar weight with more fat. Likewise, increasing your muscle mass can cause an increase in your BMR. However, skeletal muscle at rest only accounts for about 18 percent of the total energy expended by lean mass. Most is used to meet the energy needs of vital organs. The liver and brain, for example, together account for nearly half of the energy expenditure by lean mass.\nFigure 7.5. Energy expenditure of organs.\u00a0\nBMR depends not only on body composition but also on body size, sex, age, nutritional status, genetics, body temperature, and hormones (Table 7.1). People with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they have more mass. On average, women have a lower BMR than men, because they typically have a smaller frame size and less muscle mass. As we get older, muscle mass declines, and therefore BMR declines as well.\nNutritional status also affects basal metabolism. If someone is fasting or starving, or even just cutting their caloric intake for a diet, their BMR will decrease. This is because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and adapts by slowing down its basic functions (BMR) to help preserve energy and balance the decrease in energy intake. This is a protective mechanism during times of food shortages, but it also makes intentional weight loss more difficult.\n| Factors That Increase BMR | Factors That Decrease BMR |\n| --- | --- |\n| Higher lean body mass | Lower lean body mass |\n| Larger frame size | Smaller frame size |\n| Younger age | Older age |\n| Male sex | Female sex |\n| Stress, fever, illness | Starvation or fasting |\n| Elevated levels of thyroid hormone | Lower levels of thyroid hormone |\n| Pregnancy or lactation |  |\n| Stimulants such as caffeine and tobacco |  |\n|  |  |\nTable 7.1.

    "content": "Given the importance of energy\u2019s role in sustaining life, it\u2019s not surprising that energy balance is tightly regulated by complex physiological processes. A region in the brain called the hypothalamus is the main control center for hunger and satiety. There is a constant dialogue between our brains and gastrointestinal tracts through hormonal and neural signals, which determine if we feel hungry or full. The hypothalamus can sense nutrient levels in the blood, and when nutrient levels are low, the hunger center is stimulated. Conversely, when nutrient levels are high, the satiety center is stimulated.\nFigure 7.6. The hypothalamus, shown in blue, is about the size of an almond and serves as the hunger center of the brain, receiving signals from the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, and blood and signaling hunger and satiety.\nHunger is the physiological need to eat. When the stomach is empty, it contracts and starts to grumble and growl. The stomach\u2019s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus. (Of course, the stomach also contracts when it\u2019s full and hard at work digesting food, but we can\u2019t hear these movements as well because the stomach\u2019s contents muffle the noise.) The stomach is also the main organ that produces and secretes the \u201chunger hormone,\u201d ghrelin, the only gut hormone found to increase hunger. Ghrelin levels are high before a meal and fall quickly once nutrients are absorbed.3\nAppetite is the psychological desire to eat. Satiety is the sensation of feeling full. After you eat a meal, the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. There are many hormones that are associated with satiety, and various organs secrete these hormones, including the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an example of one of these satiety hormones and is secreted in response to nutrients in the gut, especially fat and protein. In addition to inhibiting food intake, CCK stimulates pancreatic secretions, gall bladder contractions, and intestinal motility\u2014all of which aide in the digestion of nutrients.3\nAdipose tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Adipose is the primary organ that produces the hormone leptin, and as fat stores increase, more leptin is produced. Higher levels of leptin communicate to the satiety center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy balance. Leptin acts on the brain to suppress hunger and increase energy expenditure. The discovery of leptin\u2019s functions sparked excitement in the research world and the weight loss industry, as it was hypothesized that leptin might be used as a weight loss drug to decrease food intake. In several clinical trials, it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it. Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person, there is generally no sustained effect on food intake.4\nFigure 7.7. The structure of the hormone leptin (left), which is primarily produced by adipose tissue. The obese mouse in the photo has a gene mutation that makes it unable to produce leptin, resulting in constant hunger, lethargy, and severe obesity. For comparison, a mouse with normal leptin production is also shown. Such gene mutations are rare, but they serve as a dramatic illustration of the importance of the hormone in signaling energy balance.",

    "content": "Energy balance seems like it should be a simple math problem, and in fact, it is based on a fundamental truth in physics\u2014the first law of thermodynamics. This law states that energy can\u2019t be created or destroyed; it can only change form. That is, calories that are consumed must go somewhere, and if they aren\u2019t metabolized (which converts caloric energy to heat and work energy), they\u2019ll have to be stored, usually in the form of adipose tissue. What makes energy balance challenging is the reality that both energy intake and energy expenditure are dynamic variables that are constantly changing, in response to each other and overall energy balance.5,6\nLet\u2019s first look at the energy intake side. As we\u2019ve already discussed, how much food we eat each day is not just a matter of willpower or self-control. It\u2019s the result of powerful physiological and psychological forces that tell us if we need to eat, or if we\u2019ve had enough. Our brains are hard-wired to seek food if we\u2019re in negative energy balance, an instinct required for survival. This means that if you start to exercise more\u2014increasing your energy expenditure\u2014you will also feel hungrier, because your body needs more fuel to support the increase in physical activity. If you eat fewer calories, perhaps in an effort to lose weight, your stomach will produce more ghrelin, and your adipose tissue will produce less leptin. These and other shifting hormone levels work together to increase hunger and make you focus on obtaining more calories. People who try to gain weight run into the opposite problem. Their leptin levels increase, suppressing hunger. It\u2019s also uncomfortable to eat beyond satiety, and food doesn\u2019t taste as good once you\u2019re full.\nEven measuring how much energy is consumed is not as simple as you might think. We can measure the caloric content of food from a chemical standpoint, but we can only estimate how much energy a person will absorb from that food. This will depend on how well the food is digested and how well the macronutrients are absorbed\u2014factors which vary depending on the food itself, the digestion efficiency of the person eating it, and even the microbes living in their gut. Two people may eat the exact same meal, yet not absorb the same number of calories.\nEnergy expenditure is also dynamic and changes under different conditions, including increased or decreased caloric intake. Decreased caloric intake and negative energy balance cause a drop in BMR to conserve energy. Muscles also become more efficient, requiring less energy to work, and without realizing it, people in negative energy balance often decrease their NEAT activity level. These adaptations help to conserve body weight and make it more difficult to stay in negative energy balance. People may still be able to lose weight despite their bodies working to prevent it, but maintaining a new, lower weight requires constant vigilance, and weight regain is common.\nResearch has also shown that people respond differently to positive energy balance. When a group of people are overfed, the amount of weight gained amongst study participants varies widely. In a study of identical twins who were given an extra 1,000 calories per day for 100 days, weight gain varied between 10 and 30 pounds among participants. Weight gain between twins was more similar (though not exactly the same), which may be attributed to genetic factors.7 People gain and lose weight differently; we don\u2019t necessarily follow formulas.\nWhen people say that the answer to weight gain is to eat less and move more, they may be partially correct. But this is also an oversimplified answer, because of all the complexities underlying energy intake and energy expenditure.",

In addition, body weight or fatness does not determine a person\u2019s health, and health encompasses not just physical health but also mental health and social well-being.\nHere\u2019s how the authors of the text \u201cSport Nutrition for Health and Performance\u201d describe a healthy body weight1:\n* A weight that is appropriate for your age and physical development\n* A weight you can achieve and sustain without severely curtailing your food intake and constantly dieting\n* A weight that is compatible with normal blood pressure, lipid levels, and glucose tolerance (in other words, you are metabolically fit)\n* A weight that is based on your genetic background and family history of body shape and weight (after all the apple doesn\u2019t fall too far from the tree)\n* A weight that promotes good eating habits and allows you to participate in regular physical activity\n* A weight that is acceptable to you\nAnother way of describing healthy body weight is \u201cbest weight,\u201d suggested in the 2020 Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guidelines as a way for physicians working with patients who want to lose weight to help center their goals. \u201cBest weight\u201d is described as \u201cthe weight that a person can achieve and maintain while living their healthiest and happiest life.\u201d2 It is thus not based on a number on the scale or a metric of body composition, but on individual bodies, lifestyle, and family history. It requires a truly individual assessment, and it isn\u2019t dictated by a formula, fad, or societal expectations.\nYet, the truth is that simple metrics are often used to assess body size and composition. We find them in online calculators, on scales at the gym, and in our doctors\u2019 offices. None of these metrics give anywhere near a complete picture of an individual\u2019s health or whether they are at their best weight.

    "content": "Because of its simplicity, BMI is a useful metric for researchers studying large groups of people. For example, BMI is used to track changes in body size within a population over time. It is also used in research studies looking at correlations between BMI and health conditions.\nIn general, studies have consistently shown that having a very low BMI or high BMI is associated with greater health risks, because there are health risks to carrying too little or too much body fat. When researchers have looked at BMI and health in large groups of people, they have often found that the lowest risk of dying younger is in the range of BMI of 20 to 25.4-6 BMI values in the overweight and especially the obesity range have generally been found to be associated with higher rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and some types of cancer, as well as other complications of obesity, such as osteoarthritis.6-10\nHowever, which BMI range is associated with the best health outcomes is somewhat controversial, and different studies have come to different conclusions. For example, a meta-analysis published by CDC researchers in 2013 found that a BMI of 25 to 30 (classified as overweight) was associated with the lowest risk of mortality, and there was no difference between normal BMI or class 1 obesity in mortality risk.11 We see a similar pattern in studies of specific health conditions. A 2022 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association reported that among patients with coronary artery disease followed for 3 to 5 years, the risk of death was lowest in those with BMI of 25 to 35 (overweight to class 1 obesity).12 In another recent study of people with type 2 diabetes, the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease or of having a heart attack or stroke was also lowest in people with BMI classified as overweight or class 1 obesity.13\nThe finding that overweight or mild obesity based on BMI can be associated with better health outcomes is often called the \u201cobesity paradox,\u201d but some scholars argue that it is simply a reflection of our evolving understanding of the complex relationships between body size and health.14 Regardless, it is clear that health risks associated with different body sizes do not always align into neat BMI categories, and simple labels such as \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201coverweight\u201d may not be very meaningful.\nVideo: What\u2019s in a Number?

    "content": "We\u2019ve discussed how BMI is an imperfect metric of health in population studies, but it has even more limitations when it comes to indicating an individual\u2019s body composition or health. For one thing, since BMI is based only on weight and height, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between muscle mass and adipose tissue. It\u2019s not unusual for muscular athletes to be classified as overweight based on BMI, yet have relatively little body fat. On the flip side, BMI can underestimate body fatness in someone with very low muscle mass, such as a person who is elderly and frail. In addition, BMI can\u2019t tell us where body fat is located in the body, and as we\u2019ll learn, this is a major factor determining its impact on health. BMI is also not useful for estimating body fatness in a pregnant person, because pregnancy weight gain includes placental and fetal tissues.3\nBMI\u2019s accuracy in predicting body fatness is also affected by biological sex and race/ethnicity\u2014not surprising given the natural diversity in human bodies. At the same BMI, women tend to carry more body fat than men. Also at the same BMI, a Black person tends to have less body fat, and a person of Asian descent tends to have more body fat, compared to a white person. This means that a high BMI may overestimate health risk in a Black person and underestimate health risk in a person of Asian descent.3\nThis natural variation means that using BMI as a universal metric to screen for body fatness and health risk can result in misleading conclusions. For example, Black Americans have, on average, higher BMI values and higher rates of obesity (defined by BMI) than white Americans, and this is especially true for women. However, the relationship between high BMI and mortality is weaker in Black Americans; in Black women, having a higher BMI has been found to be associated with a lower death rate.16 Some scholars argue that using a crude metric like BMI in doctors\u2019 offices disproportionately harms Black women, who may be more likely to be told that weight is the cause of their health problems without acknowledging the gender- and race-related differences in BMI or the systemic issues \u2014 such as racism, poverty, pollution, and stress \u2014 that may be more important factors affecting their health.17\nAll of this means that BMI is not particularly useful for comparing one individual to another or even one population to another. And for an individual, one BMI measurement at a single point in time is not all that meaningful; other measurements and clinical assessments are needed to evaluate disease risk, as we\u2019ll discuss in a moment.\nBMI is perhaps most useful for tracking changes in body composition over time, whether of a population or an individual. For example, the data on average BMI in the U.S. show a clear increase over the last several decades, and the most likely explanation for this trend is not that people in the U.S. are all gaining several pounds of muscle each year, but that we\u2019re carrying more fat. On the other hand, someone may have a BMI classified as overweight, but if they\u2019ve been at that BMI their entire adult life and are active and metabolically healthy, they may be at their \u201cbest weight,\u201d and labeling them as \u201coverweight\u201d may be misleading and stigmatizing.",

    "content": "A person\u2019s body mass is made up of water, lean body mass (including organs, bone, and muscle), fat, and other components like minerals. The weight on the scale does not distinguish between these different components, but body composition measurements can.\nFigure 7.8. The four main components of body weight are water, fat, lean body mass, and other components like minerals.\nBody composition measurements are sometimes used by individuals and researchers to determine how much of a person\u2019s weight is made up of body fat and lean body mass. For example, an individual might use body composition measurements to track their progress in building muscle with a new strength training program. Since increased body fat can be a risk factor for diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, researchers are often interested in this type of data. There are several different methods used to measure body composition, each with advantages and limitations.18\n* Skinfold Test. This is a simple, non-invasive, and low-cost way to assess fat mass. Calipers are used to measure the thickness of skin on three to seven different parts of the body, and these numbers are then entered into a conversion equation. The accuracy of the skinfold test depends on the skill of the person taking the measurements, the accuracy of the calipers, and the appropriateness of the conversion equations. Best practice is for the same person to take repeated measurements if using them to monitor changes over time. Repeated measurements by different technicians, using different calipers, and different conversion equations will yield very different results.\nFigure 7.9. Calipers used to assess body fat during skinfold testing.\n* Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA). This is a simple, non-invasive, quick tool that does not require extensive training. BIA estimates body composition by sending a small amount of electricity through the body. Since water is a good conductor of electricity, and lean body mass contains more water than fat, the rate at which the current travels can be used to estimate percent body fat. Body fluid levels must be normal with BIA, which is a limitation, since hydration can be impacted by exercise, alcohol, and menstrual cycles.\nFigure 7.10. BIA hand device.\n* Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP).\u00a0This is a non-invasive, quick tool that does not take extensive training. It\u2019s more accurate but also more expensive than BIA. While a person sits inside an enclosed chamber (usually called a Bod Pod), changes in air pressure are used to determine the amount of air that is displaced in the test chamber, which can determine body volume. These measurements are then translated into percent body fat. Hydration status can affect the accuracy of this test. This test also needs to be conducted in a facility with a Bod Pod, so it is not as accessible as the skinfold test or the BIA.\nFigure 7.11. Body composition measurement with whole-body air displacement plethysmography (ADP) technology or BodPod\n* Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA).\u00a0This method directs two low-dose X-ray beams through the body and determines the amount of energy absorbed from the beams. The amount of energy absorbed is dependent on the body\u2019s content of bone, lean tissue mass, and fat mass. Using standard mathematical formulas, fat content and bone density can be accurately estimated. Although this is one of the most accurate methods of measuring fat mass, it is expensive and mostly used in research. It also requires low doses of radiation to the subject being tested, and is not appropriate for pregnant women.\nFigure 7.12. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)\nKeep in mind that body composition can be hard to measure accurately when using inexpensive and accessible techniques like skinfold testing and BIA. Your best bet is to pick one method and use it over time to compare numbers and see how they change.",

This is because visceral fat that surrounds vital organs (common in central obesity or apple-shaped fat patterning) is more metabolically active, releasing more hormones and inflammatory factors thought to contribute to disease risk compared to subcutaneous fat. Subcutaneous fat stored just below the skin (common in pear-shaped fat patterning) does not seem to significantly increase the risk for chronic disease. In fact, having more lower body subcutaneous fat such as in the hips and thighs may even protect against developing chronic diseases.19\nFigure 7.13. Fat can be located in the abdominal region (apple shape) or hips, thighs, and buttocks (pear shape).\nBody fat distribution can be measured by waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, both of which only require a measuring tape.\n* Waist circumference is measured just above the hip bone, level with your belly button. Men with a waist circumference greater than 40 inches and women with a waist circumference greater than 35 inches are predicted to face greater health risks.\n* Waist-to-hip ratio is calculated by measuring waist circumference and hip circumference (at its widest part) and dividing the two values. Abdominal obesity is defined by the World Health Organization as a waist-to-hip ratio above 0.90 for men and above 0.85 for women.",

    "content": "Metabolic health refers to the body\u2019s ability to maintain normal homeostasis and effectively regulate measures like blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood glucose. It is often assumed that when an individual is classified as overweight and obese based on measurements of BMI, body composition, and fat distribution, metabolic health is negatively impacted. However, some individuals who meet the criteria for obesity do not experience an increased risk of metabolic health.20 These individuals are known as metabolically healthy obese (MHO). Metabolically healthy can be described as an absence of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.\nAlong the same lines, there are also individuals who are classified as normal weight (BMI < 25) but show an increased metabolic risk. These individuals are known as metabolically obese normal weight (MONW).\nIn a 2016 study, researchers analyzed BMI and measures of metabolic health (blood pressure, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, blood glucose, insulin resistance, and a marker of inflammation) for more than 40,000 Americans. Among the group classified as normal weight based on BMI, 69% were metabolically healthy based on measures of metabolic health, and 31% were metabolically unhealthy. In the higher BMI categories, the proportion of metabolically healthy people declined, but a significant number of individuals with larger body sizes had normal values for measures of metabolic health; 47% of people classified as overweight, 29% of those classified as having obesity, and 16% of those classified as having class 2 or 3 obesity were metabolically healthy.21 In other words, a person\u2019s body size is not an accurate indicator of their metabolic health, and it\u2019s important to measure and track more direct indicators of health and disease risk such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood lipid levels.\nThese variations may challenge the assumptions we hold about body fatness. It can not be assumed that thinness equals health or that fatness indicates a lack of health.",

    "content": "As the previous section illustrated, most measures of body composition are imperfect estimates, and they are often not accurate indicators of health. However, in general, carrying too little and too much body fat are both correlated with greater health issues.\nWe see this pattern in studies of mortality risk and BMI, which usually report a J-shaped curve indicating a greater risk of dying sooner at low and high BMI. The lowest average mortality risk is usually found somewhere between BMI values of about 20 and 30, corresponding to normal and overweight BMI categories. Which BMI category is correlated to the lowest mortality risk is controversial, and different studies have reached different conclusions depending on the population studied and the statistical methods used. Most studies find the lowest mortality rate in the normal range with little to no increase in mortality in the overweight range for BMI,1-3 and some find that the overweight group has the lowest mortality rate.4-6\nAs an example, the results of a 2018 study of 3.6 million adults in the UK are shown below.1 You can see that the relationship between BMI and mortality rate varies by biological sex and age group, but the general pattern holds.\nFig. 7.14. The relationship between BMI and mortality risk (higher HR on the y-axis indicates higher risk of dying during the study) forms a J-shaped curve, which can vary depending on factors like sex and age. This example is from Bhaskaran et al. (2018) and illustrates the typical pattern seen in similar studies, although the exact placement of the curve along the BMI scale varies between studies. \nWhat are the specific risks associated with carrying too little or too much body fat?

Globally, the World Health Organization estimated that in 2014, approximately 462 million adults were underweight.9\nKeep in mind that BMI is used to classify underweight, and just as it\u2019s a crude measure for estimating health risks associated with higher body fat, the same can be true for underweight. Some people are genetically predisposed to be lean, and they may be at their \u201cbest weight\u201d even if their BMI classifies them as underweight.\nAdipose tissue plays important roles in the body. It is our largest form of energy storage, helping us to survive during periods of low food supply and storing extra energy during periods of abundance. Adipose also provides insulation and padding, and it produces hormones and other signals that regulate metabolism and support immune function. It is critical for reproductive function, including normal secretion of sex and reproductive hormones, pubertal development, pregnancy, and lactation.10\nBeing underweight has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of several health conditions:11-16\n* Osteoporosis and low bone mineral density\n* Increased risk of infection, delayed wound healing, and greater post-surgical complications\n* Cardiovascular disease, including stroke, heart attack, and coronary heart disease\n* Some cancers, plus poorer response to treatment and survival rates after diagnosis\n* Irregular menstrual cycles, decreased fertility, and poorer pregnancy outcomes\n* Depression in women\n* Decreased semen quality in men\n* Stunted growth in children\nThe most common underlying cause of underweight in the U.S. is inadequate nutrition, which may occur because of lack of access to enough food; difficulty eating or digesting food, which is common in older adults; or disordered eating. Note that eating disorders do not always cause underweight and can be present in people of all body sizes. Eating disorders are covered in greater depth on the next page.\nOther causes of underweight include wasting diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and tuberculosis. People with wasting diseases are encouraged to seek nutritional counseling, as a healthy diet greatly affects survival and improves responses to disease treatments.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), overweight and obesity are linked to more deaths worldwide than underweight.19\nCarrying too much body fat can affect health through several mechanisms. Fat cells are not lifeless storage tanks\u2014they\u2019re dynamic, metabolically-active tissue that secrete a number of different hormones and hormone-like messengers, causing low-grade inflammation that\u2019s believed to contribute to chronic disease development such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer.20 Carrying more body weight can also contribute to joint problems and difficulty with mobility.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity is associated with an increased risk of the following health conditions21:\n* High blood pressure and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease\n* Type 2 diabetes\n* Breathing problems such as asthma and sleep apnea\n* Joint problems such as osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal discomfort\n* Gallstones and gallbladder disease\n* Stroke\n* Many types of cancer\n* Depression and anxiety\nChildren with obesity face many of these same health risks, and they are more likely to have obesity as adults. Obesity in children is also associated with lower self-esteem and facing greater social challenges such as bullying and stigma.21\nAs we discussed on the previous page, a significant number of people living in larger bodies\u2014who might be classified as overweight or obese based on BMI\u2014are metabolically healthy.22 Health issues may be more common in people carrying more fat, but many other factors are at play, including genetics, the location of body fat (subcutaneous or visceral), diet quality, physical activity, socioeconomic factors, and environmental factors. Most of the studies on obesity and health conditions are observational, and as we covered in Unit 2, observational research can only show correlations, not causation. And with so many overlapping factors involved, it can be difficult to tease apart correlation and causation. For example, a person with a family history and genetic predisposition for diabetes or heart disease might also have a genetic predisposition for higher body weight, so it is difficult to say whether or how much higher body weight contributed to the development of disease.\nLikewise, as we\u2019ll discuss later in the unit, factors such as access to healthcare and education, food security, poverty, neighborhood safety, housing stability, stress, and racism can affect both body weight and health. These factors are called social determinants of health and are defined by the CDC as \u201cconditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes.\u201d If a person living in a larger body has health problems, we shouldn\u2019t assume that those problems are caused by their weight, as there could be numerous contributing factors.23 In addition, many of the health problems associated with obesity can be mitigated by lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity or improved diet quality, so just as excess weight may not be the sole cause of associated health issues, weight loss is also not the only answer.24\nTo further add to the complexity of this discussion, studies of the relationship between weight and health rarely account for the effects of weight stigma. As we\u2019ll discuss in more detail below, research has shown that experiencing weight stigma may contribute to both weight gain and poorer health outcomes.",

    "content": "According to the 2020 Joint International Consensus Statement for Ending Stigma of Obesity, \u201cweight stigma refers to social devaluation and denigration of individuals because of their excess body weight, and can lead to negative attitudes, stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.\u201d The statement, which was authored by 36 experts from around the world, is a call to action for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public to end weight stigma.30 It begins:\n\u201cIndividuals with obesity face not only increased risk of serious medical complications but also a pervasive, resilient form of social stigma. Often perceived (without evidence) as lazy, gluttonous, lacking will power and self-discipline, individuals with overweight or obesity are vulnerable to stigma and discrimination in the workplace, education, healthcare settings, and society in general. Weight stigma can cause considerable harm to affected individuals, including physical and psychological consequences. The damaging impact of weight stigma, however, extends beyond harm to individuals. The prevailing view that obesity is a choice and that it can be entirely reversed by voluntary decisions to eat less and exercise more can exert negative influences on public health policies, access to treatments, and research.\u201d\n\u201cAbout 40% of the general population reports that it has experienced some type of weight stigma\u2014whether it be weight-based teasing, unfair treatment, or discrimination,\u201d said Rebecca Puhl, PhD, deputy director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at the University of Connecticut, in Today\u2019s Dietitian.31 Weight stigma can be experienced in nearly every aspect of life, including the workplace, healthcare, social settings, and even within a person\u2019s own family.\nFig. 7.15. Common sources of weight stigmatization identified by individuals who are overweight or obese include families, social environments, work environments, and service providers, as well as generalized feelings of judgment from others. Source: Cossrow, N. H., Jeffery, R. W., & McGuire, M. T. (2001). Understanding weight stigmatization: A focus group study. Journal of nutrition education, 33(4), 208-214.\nExperiencing weight stigma has been associated with many negative physical and mental health outcomes30:\n* Lower self-esteem and greater levels of depression, anxiety, social isolation, stress, and substance use\n* Unhealthy eating and weight control behaviors, such as binge eating\n* Exercise avoidance and lower levels of physical activity\n* Greater weight gain over time\n* Higher levels of inflammatory markers and stress hormones\n* Greater long-term cardiometabolic risk and increased mortality\n* Lower quality medical care, poorer treatment outcomes, and avoidance of medical care\nIt is important to note that these effects have been shown to be associated with experiencing weight stigma, above and beyond the consequences of excess body weight. And as noted above, this research points to weight stigma as one of the factors that contributes to poorer health among people with larger bodies.\nCombatting weight stigma and discrimination will require change on many levels. Governments can include weight as a category covered in anti-discrimination laws. Anti-bullying efforts at the school level should include policies on harassment and bullying related to weight. Healthcare should include reimbursement for obesity treatment, and weight bias training should be required for healthcare providers. Providers should ensure that their facilities are comfortable and welcoming to people of all sizes, and that they offer evidence-based care and treatment options to all patients, regardless of their size. And education and awareness about weight bias on an individual level will help change negative attitudes toward overweight and obesity.30,32\nVIDEO: \u201cWeight of the Nation: Stigma\u2014The Human Cost of Obesity\u201d by HBO Docs, YouTube (May 14, 2012), 18:54.",

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) defines eating disorders as \u201cserious and sometimes fatal illnesses that cause severe disturbances to a person\u2019s eating behaviors.\u201d1 People with eating disorders often experience a preoccupation with food choices and body weight, and they frequently have a distorted body image, believing that self-worth is tied to body size and shape.2 Eating disorders are serious and complex health conditions, and their prevention, proper diagnosis, and treatment must involve a multi-faceted approach, including physical, emotional, and social issues related to each individual\u2019s needs.3\nThe short video below summarizes the main types of eating disorders, and you\u2019ll find sections with more details on each type further down this page.\nVIDEO: \u201cEating Disorders: What Are They?\u201d by the National Eating Disorders Association, YouTube (August 3, 2018), 3:28. This short video offers a summary of the characteristics of the main types of eating disorders.\nResearchers have estimated that about 9 percent of people living in the United States, or 28.8 million Americans, will have an eating disorder in their lifetime.4 The prevalence of eating disorders also seems to be increasing.5 Eating disorders can be accompanied by many health complications, and among all mental illnesses, eating disorders have one of the highest fatality rates. Anorexia nervosa in particular can be deadly; it has the second highest mortality rate of mental illnesses, outranked only by substance use disorder.6 Eating disorders cause approximately 10,200 deaths each year, or one death every 52 minutes in the United States.4 In a large study of U.S. college students published in 2020, those with the greatest level of eating disorder symptoms were 11 times more likely to have attempted suicide compared with those who did not have an eating disorder.7\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis and needs immediate help, call the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nHistorically, there has been a stereotype of eating disorders typically affecting young, white, straight women and resulting in a visibly underweight body. But this is a false stereotype. Eating disorders can affect anyone, regardless of their background, body size, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, or age. This is an important point because misconceptions about who is affected by eating disorders have resulted in these illnesses being underrecognized, undiagnosed, and untreated in people who don\u2019t fit the stereotype.8\nVIDEO: \u201cPeople of color with eating disorders face cultural, medical stigmas\u201d by PBS Frontline, YouTube (March 28, 2022), 9:19.

For example, in one U.S. survey, adults who reported experiencing weight stigma were more likely to have disordered eating, regardless of BMI.10 In another study, 14-year-old girls who were told by a family member or another person in their life that they were \u201ctoo fat\u201d were, at age 19, more likely to be dissatisfied with their body and to be using unhealthy weight control behaviors, such as vomiting, taking diet pills, and using laxatives. These effects were seen regardless of BMI, meaning that these unhealthy outcomes also occurred in girls with a normal weight BMI who were labeled by others as \u201ctoo fat.\u201d11 In one cohort of teens followed for three years, those who dieted were five times more likely to develop eating disorders, and those who were on severely restrictive diets were 18 times more likely to develop eating disorders.12 It\u2019s also worth noting that dieting in young people is actually linked to greater weight gain over time, not less. For these reasons, the American Academy of Pediatrics discourages dieting in young people and recommends that families concerned about a child\u2019s body weight focus on adopting healthy and sustainable eating and physical activity patterns rather than trying to change weight.13 When we talk about weight management interventions or public health policies, it\u2019s important to be mindful of the risks of overly restrictive diets or practices that stigmatize people based on weight.\nWith proper diagnosis and treatment, people can recover completely from eating disorders. Treatment can involve individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy; medical care and monitoring; nutrition counseling; and medications such as antidepressants and mood stabilizers. A registered dietitian is often a vital part of the treatment team.1.",

A 2019 review of studies estimated that 1.4 percent of women and 0.2 percent of men will have anorexia at some point in their lifetime.14 Anorexia often begins during adolescence, but it can emerge much later in adulthood. In addition to severe food restriction, some people with anorexia also may exercise compulsively and have binge-eating and purging episodes, during which they eat large amounts of food and then purge it by vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics.1 Though some people with anorexia are noticeably underweight, the disorder can also affect people in larger bodies, who may be less likely to be diagnosed because of their size.15\nAnorexia can affect mental and physical health in many ways. It can cause excessive weight loss, osteoporosis, anemia, muscle wasting and weakness, brittle hair and nails, skin abnormalities, growth of fine hair all over the body, severe constipation, low blood pressure, slowed pulse and breathing rate, low body temperature, fatigue, infertility, menstrual irregularities or loss of periods, heart and brain damage, and organ failure.1 The goals of treatment for anorexia are to restore a healthy body weight and significantly reduce the weight obsession and behaviors associated with the eating disorder.",

The term \u201corthorexia\u201d was first defined in 1998, but it has yet to be formally classified as an eating disorder, making it difficult to determine how prevalent it is. Research suggests it may be identified as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. While focusing on a healthy diet isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, a person with orthorexia takes the emphasis on healthy or \u201cclean\u201d eating to the extreme, so much so that it becomes a fixation, putting their health at risk. Signs of orthorexia include compulsively reading food labels, cutting several food groups out of the diet, spending an unusual amount of time focusing on what foods may be available at upcoming events, and experiencing a high level of stress when healthy foods are not available. The obsession with healthfulness comes with a high social cost as it is often difficult to enjoy eating out or sharing meals with friends and family. There is no formal treatment plan for orthorexia, but many eating disorder experts treat it similarly to anorexia and obsessive-compulsive disorder.19\nIf you think you or someone close to you may have an eating disorder and you want to learn more or find help, we\u2019ve provided links to more resources below.

Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show rising rates of obesity across the nation, state-by-state.1Fig 7.17. Each year since 1990, the CDC has published maps of the United States in which states are color-coded based on the percentage of their population estimated to be obese. The maps show a clear increase in the prevalence of obesity between 1990 and 2010.\nThe methods used by the CDC to collect the data changed in 2011, so we can\u2019t make direct comparisons between the periods before and after that change, but the trend has continued. Every year, more and more people in the U.S. report having a BMI that classifies them as having obesity, a trend that public health officials have labeled the obesity epidemic.  \nFig 7.18. The prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults has continued to rise between 2011 and 2020.\nThese trends are unmistakable, and they\u2019re not just occurring in adults. Childhood obesity has seen similar increases over the last few decades. This is a concern because the metabolic and health effects of carrying too much weight can be compounded over a person\u2019s lifetime, and people with obesity in childhood are more likely to also have obesity as adults.2\nFig 7.19.

Based on 2017-2018 data, the prevalence of obesity is 50 percent among Black adults, 45 percent among Hispanic adults, 42 percent among white adults, and 17 percent among Asian adults in the U.S. Overall, people who are college-educated and have a higher income are less likely to be obese.3These health disparities\u00a0point to the importance of looking at social determinants of health when examining causes and solutions. Not everyone has the same opportunity for good health, or an equal ability to make changes to their circumstances, because of factors like poverty and longstanding inequities in how resources are invested in communities.4\nIn addition to the health issues that can be associated with obesity, excess weight is also associated with greater costs of medical care. Cost estimates vary widely, in part because it\u2019s very difficult to tease out health issues caused by obesity versus those correlated with it. A 2016 review of studies found that, on average, a person with obesity had $1,901 greater medical costs than a person classified as normal weight, adding up to $149 billion in the United States.5A 2021 study reported similar cost estimates.6The obesity epidemic is also not unique to the United States. Obesity is rising around the globe, and in 2015, it was estimated to affect 2 billion people worldwide, making it one of the largest factors affecting poor health in most countries.7Previously, overweight and obesity mainly affected high-income countries, but some of the most dramatic increases in childhood overweight over the last decade have been in low income countries, such as those in Africa and South Asia.\nDespite the gravity of the problem, no country has yet been able to implement policies that have reversed the trend and brought about a decrease in obesity. This represents \u201cone of the biggest population health failures of our time,\u201d wrote an international group of researchers in the journal The Lancet\u00a0in 2019.9\u00a0Turning the tide will require an understanding of the complex causes of the rise in excess weight. As we\u2019ll see, these are interwoven into our environments, economies, societies, and policies, and we can thus assume that effective solutions will need to go far beyond the simplistic advice that people should \u201ceat less and move more.\u201d",

    "content": "What has caused the rise in obesity around the world? This question is still an active area of debate among researchers. The predominant explanation comes back to the concept of energy balance: A chronic shift towards positive energy balance\u2014consuming more energy or calories than expended\u2014has led to a gradual but persistent increase in body weight. This shift is thought to be the result of changes in the environments in which we live, which include fewer opportunities for physical activity and greater availability and marketing of inexpensive, convenient, energy-dense foods.10\u00a0\nPutting the focus on energy balance often leads people to assume that obesity is an individual problem\u2014that those who weigh more simply need to change their behavior to eat less and exercise more, and if this doesn\u2019t work, it must be because of a personal failing, such as a lack of self-control or motivation. However, science tells us that the reality is far more complex. Many factors can contribute to energy balance, and neurological and hormonal control of food intake and energy expenditure mean that it\u2019s difficult to maintain a negative energy balance and weight loss. Some researchers also argue that food intake and physical activity can\u2019t explain the continued increase in body weight, and we need to look to alternative explanations.11In the sections below, we discuss some of the hypothesized causes for the rise in obesity, acknowledging there are likely multiple causes to this complex issue.",

    "content": "Many of us live in what researchers and public health experts call \u201cobesogenic environments.\u201d That is, the ways in which our neighborhoods are built and our lives are structured influence our physical activity and food intake to encourage weight gain.12Human physiology and metabolism evolved in a world where obtaining enough food for survival required significant energy investment in hunting or gathering\u2014very different from today\u2019s world where more people earn their living in sedentary occupations. From household chores, to workplace productivity, to daily transportation, getting things done requires fewer calories than it did in past generations. \nFig 7.20. Some elements of our environment that may make it easier to gain weight include sedentary jobs, easy access to inexpensive calories, and cities built more for car travel than for physical activity.\nOur jobs have become more and more sedentary, with fewer opportunities for non-exercise thermogenesis (NEAT) throughout the day. There\u2019s less time in the school day for recess and physical activity, and lack of neighborhood safety can limit kids\u2019 ability to get out and play after the school day is over. Our towns and cities are built more for cars than for walking or biking. We can\u2019t turn back the clock on human progress, and finding ways to stay active in modern environments is a significant challenge.\nThat said, recent research has called into question the role of physical activity in driving the rise in obesity. Studies of modern hunter-gatherer societies on the savannas of Africa have found that these very active people burn a similar number of calories each day as adults living more sedentary lifestyles in modern cities.13In addition, even as rates of obesity have continued to increase, research suggests that physical activity among U.S. adults has also been increasing.11Also, some studies find that people with higher BMI are more physically active than those in the normal weight category. \u201cThese findings contrast with conventional views that primarily attribute the cause of obesity to sedentary lifestyles and suggest that compensatory metabolic adaptations maintain total energy expenditure relatively constant among human populations and across various levels of physical activities,\u201d write the authors of the Joint International Consensus Statement for Ending Stigma of Obesity.14Being physically active benefits our health in a multitude of ways, including preventing chronic diseases often associated with higher body weight, but it\u2019s not clear how much moving more affects long term energy balance or weight. \nVIDEO: This short video explains some of the research on NEAT and efforts to increase it in our lives.

People living in poorer neighborhoods often lack grocery stores where they can purchase fresh fruits and vegetables and basic ingredients for cooking at home. Such areas are called food deserts\u2014where healthy foods simply aren\u2019t available or easily accessible. In these neighborhoods, people rely more on packaged and convenience foods that are more highly processed and may lead to greater energy intake. \u00a0\nPeople living with lower and less stable incomes also have to contend with food insecurity. Food security\u00a0means \u201caccess by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.\u201d16Food insecurity\u00a0means an inability to consistently obtain adequate food. It may seem counter-intuitive, but in the United States, food insecurity is linked to obesity. That is, people who have difficulty obtaining enough food are more likely to become obese and to suffer from diabetes and hypertension. This is likely related to the fact that inexpensive foods tend to be high in calories but low in nutrients, and when these foods form the foundation of a person\u2019s diet, they can cause both obesity and nutrient deficiencies. It\u2019s estimated that 12 percent of U.S. households are food insecure, and food insecurity is higher among Black (22 percent) and Latino (18 percent) households.17\nPoor neighborhoods are also sometimes not safe or pleasant places to walk, play, or exercise. They may have busy traffic and polluted air, and they may lack sidewalks, green spaces, and playgrounds. A person living in this type of neighborhood will find it much more challenging to incorporate physical activity into their day compared with someone living in a neighborhood where it\u2019s safe to walk to school or work, play at a park, ride a bike, or go for a run.\nSocial determinants of health likely drive and compound the racial and ethnic differences in obesity prevalence. Studies show that U.S. regions with more racial inequality in poverty, unemployment, and homeownership\u2014all factors driven by historic and present-day inequities\u2014have greater rates of obesity. In addition, experiencing racism and bias results in chronic stress, which is associated with greater weight gain.18-19\nFigure 7.21.

    "content": "Social determinants of health have a strong impact on obesity risk, so prevention efforts understandably target areas such as access to healthy foods and safe and affordable opportunities for physical activity. These are important, but fully addressing them will likely require societies to dig deeper into the root causes of existing disparities, to look at how factors such as poverty, racism, and discrimination affect people\u2019s opportunities for health. This means looking at how communities and governments can work toward health equity, defined as \u201cthe fair and just opportunity for all to be as healthy as possible,\u201d requiring removal of obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences.2\nConsider low income neighborhoods that lack grocery stores, leaving residents without access to fresh foods and cooking ingredients. Policies and programs that bring groceries into these neighborhoods are important, but they may not do much to improve the nutrition or the food security of residents if they can\u2019t afford to shop there or have no time to cook because they need to work multiple jobs to support their families. Likewise, programs that give children bicycles or teach them about the importance of physical activity may not have an impact if there are no safe places to ride a bike or play in their neighborhood. Looking at this issue through the lens of health equity means tackling even bigger issues of poverty and access to education, resources, and safety. In this sense, policies and programs at community, state, and national levels that seek to improve people\u2019s lives by reducing income inequality and improving access to resources can help to target some of the core causes of obesity in populations.3\nAn example of community-based interventions that aim to reduce health disparities can be found in the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health across the United States (REACH US) project, launched by the CDC in 2007. REACH US invested in many projects across the U.S., including 14 projects in predominantly Black communities aiming to reduce cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Each community project was unique and depended on local needs and preferences, but all included community coalitions, involving local leaders and residents, and targeted access to healthy food and/or improving physical activity opportunities. Between 2009 and 2012, the prevalence of obesity in REACH US communities dropped by 5 percent, while it increased by 2 percent in nearby comparison communities without a REACH program.4",

Weight stigma is unacceptable in modern societies, as it undermines human rights, social rights, and the health of afflicted individuals.\n* Research indicates that weight stigma can cause significant harm to affected individuals. Individuals who experience it suffer from both physical and psychological consequences, and are less likely to seek and receive adequate healthcare.\n* Despite scientific evidence to the contrary, the prevailing view in society is that obesity is a choice that can be reversed by voluntary decisions to eat less and exercise more. These assumptions mislead public health policies, confuse messages in popular media, undermine access to evidence-based treatments, and compromise advances in research.\n* For the reasons above, weight stigma represents a major obstacle in efforts to effectively prevent and treat obesity and type 2 diabetes. Tackling stigma is not only a matter of human rights and social justice, but also a way to advance prevention and treatment of these diseases.\n* Academic institutions, professional organizations, media, public health authorities, and government should encourage education about weight stigma and facilitate a new public narrative of obesity, coherent with modern scientific knowledge.",

Here are some examples:\n* Implement and support better nutrition standards for childcare, schools, hospitals, and worksites. The National School Lunch Program in particular provides meals for approximately 30 million children from low-income families each school day, and recent changes in school lunch standards have improved dietary quality for students consuming school lunches.3,6\n* Limit or end marketing of processed foods and sugar sweetened beverages, especially ads that disproportionately target children of color.7\n* Provide incentives for supermarkets and farmers markets to establish businesses in underserved areas.7\nFigure 7.22. Farmers markets can expand healthy food options for neighborhoods and build connections between consumers and local farmers.\n* Increase access to food assistance programs and align them with nutrition recommendations. For example, in 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture revised the food packages for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program to better align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The new packages emphasized more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy and decreased the availability of juice. After this change, between 2010 and 2016, there was a decrease in the obesity rate of children in the WIC program.8 Similar progress may be made by increasing access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in order to reduce food insecurity, and providing incentives to use SNAP benefits on foods like fruits and vegetables. Many farmers\u2019 markets now accept SNAP benefits for the purchase of fresh fruit and vegetables.7\n* Tax sugary drinks, such as soda and sports drinks, which contribute significant empty calories to the U.S. diet and are associated with childhood obesity. Local taxes on soda and other sugary drinks are often controversial, and soda companies lobby to prevent them from passing. However, research from U.S. cities with soda taxes show that they do work to decrease soda consumption, and one study concluded that a national soda tax may be the most cost-effective obesity prevention measure, estimating that it could prevent more than 500,000 cases of childhood obesity over 10 years.7 In the U.S., soda has only been taxed at the local level, and the tax has been paid by consumers. The United Kingdom has taken a different approach: They started taxing soft drink manufacturers for the sugar content of the products they sell. Between 2015 and 2018, the average sugar content of soda sold in the U.K. dropped by 29 percent.9\n* A controversial policy intervention has been the requirement that restaurant menus include calorie information. Beginning in 2018, as part of the Affordable Care Act, chain restaurants in the U.S. with more than 20 locations were required to add calorie information to their menus, and some had already done so voluntarily. Overall, the research on menu labeling has shown it may slightly reduce the calorie count of restaurant purchases, but it doesn\u2019t seem to reduce calories consumed in a sitting, and there\u2019s no evidence that menu labeling affects total calories consumed in the long term, dietary quality, or risk of obesity.10\nFig 7.23.

    "content": "As we discussed earlier in this unit, energy balance determines whether we are gaining, losing, or maintaining body weight. To lose weight, we need to shift into a negative energy balance, so that we are consuming fewer calories than we are burning each day. Most people find that they are able to do this by restricting their calorie or macronutrient intake (i.e., dieting) for a short period of time, perhaps 6 months or a year, and they may lose 5 to 10 percent of their body weight. However, it is very common for people to experience gradual weight regain within a year or two. This fact is what fuels the diet industry; diet companies market their plans based on short-term success stories and frame the longer term reality of weight regain as personal failing or lack of willpower. Even scientific studies of weight loss rarely follow people for more than 12 months, which can lead to reporting of overly optimistic results.14,15\nWhy is it so difficult to maintain a reduced body weight? Keep in mind that weight, like so many other parts of our physiology, is tightly regulated. Our bodies can make adjustments to both sides of the energy balance equation to help us maintain a steady weight. During periods of negative energy balance, the body signals weight loss as a threat to survival, and these regulatory mechanisms kick in to defend the original weight. Basal metabolic rate drops to conserve energy and protect against starvation. Skeletal muscles also become more efficient, so that they need less energy to fuel their movement. Additionally, after weight loss, there is less physical mass of the body that has to be moved from place to place throughout the day, resulting in fewer calories burned through physical movement and activity, and less metabolically active tissue using calories for fuel throughout the day. These metabolic changes conserve energy, reducing the \u201cenergy out\u201d side of the energy balance equation and favoring weight regain.16,17 In individuals maintaining a 10% or greater weight loss, these changes combine to account for an estimated decrease of 300-400 calories in energy expenditure per day beyond what is expected due to the change in body composition alone.18\nOn the \u201cenergy in\u201d side of the equation, neurological and hormonal changes also increase appetite, lower satiety, and increase the brain\u2019s focus on obtaining food. Researchers have estimated that weight loss of about 2 pounds increases appetite by about 95 calories per day.16,17 These biological factors and their influence on weight are discussed further in the video below.\nVIDEO: \u201cThe Quest to Understand the Biology of Weight Loss,\u201d by HBO Docs, YouTube (May 14, 2012), 22:52 minutes.\nBiological differences in individual metabolism may also impact weight loss and maintenance. Researchers have found that some individuals have a \u201cthrifty\u201d metabolism, meaning that they have a lower metabolic rate and will expend significantly fewer calories when in a fasting or calorie-restricted state, resulting in less weight loss. In contrast, individuals with a \u201cspendthrift\u201d metabolism tend to have a higher metabolic rate in a fasting state, burning more calories and thus yielding bigger weight loss results.19 This research explains why some people may be able to lose weight and maintain weight loss, while others will struggle to do so, even with substantial effort.\nFig. 7.25.

    "content": "It\u2019s clear that sustained weight loss is difficult and complex. But weight loss doesn\u2019t need to be the primary goal to improve health. There are many ways to improve your health that aren\u2019t tied to changing your weight or BMI. If you\u2019re at a higher weight and concerned about your weight or health, a good starting point may be thinking of steps you can take to improve your health that are in your immediate control. For example, are you getting enough sleep? What strategies can you take to reduce your stress level? How can you improve your eating habits to better nourish your body? Can you incorporate more enjoyable forms of physical activity into your daily routine? Setting goals around behavior and health rather than a number on the scale improves your likelihood of feeling successful and making sustainable changes. And since many of these daily habits are also thought to affect weight, making positive changes may (but may not) lead to some weight loss. In addition, talk with your doctor about any medications you are using that could cause weight gain.\nIf weight loss is one of your goals, it\u2019s important to have realistic expectations. The goal of weight loss efforts should be to \u201cprevent, treat, or reverse the complications of obesity and improve the quality of life.\u201d20 Specific goals and approaches will look different for everyone depending on their individual risk factors and lifestyle. Research shows that losing just 5 percent of body weight is associated with significant health benefits such as lower blood pressure and improved blood cholesterol levels, and changing diet or exercise habits typically can reduce body weight by about 5 to 7 percent.20 However, many people set weight loss goals well beyond this mark, leading to disappointment and frustration if they fall short. It may be helpful to set a goal of reaching your \u201cbest weight,\u201d defined in the 2020 Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guidelines as \u201cthe weight that a person can achieve and maintain while living their healthiest and happiest life.\u201d21\nEven more difficult than losing weight is maintaining a reduced weight. Weight regain is common, so at the outset, it\u2019s important to think about how weight loss strategies can be sustained for the long term. Weight control registries from around the world have tracked thousands of people who have successfully lost weight and maintained a reduced weight over time. While these registries include self-selected samples and thus are not representative of all people attempting weight loss, their findings provide some examples of the types of habits associated with maintaining individual weight loss. For example, more than 80 percent of global registry members report consuming breakfast daily, increasing their consumption of vegetables and high fiber foods, eating regular meals, watching their consumption of foods higher in fat and sugar, and keeping healthy foods on hand at home. Physical activity is also an important part of their ongoing efforts; most registry members reported exercising regularly, many for about an hour per day.22",

    "content": "There are many dietary approaches to weight loss, and research shows that there is no single dietary strategy that is superior to others. Dietary approaches that have been shown to be effective, at least in the short-term, include the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, vegetarian diet, and a variety of lower-calorie macronutrient distribution diets, such as low-fat and low- carbohydrate approaches.14\nWhile not specifically about weight loss, the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans also offers specific, evidence-based recommendations for dietary habits that provide a good roadmap for healthy eating. These guidelines are aimed at keeping calorie intake in balance with physical activity, which is key for weight management. These recommendations include following a healthy eating pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie level. Unit 1: Tools for Achieving a Healthy Diet includes a more detailed look at these guidelines.\nMost Americans do not meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines, indicating room for improvement in dietary quality. Figure 7.26 shows how Americans are falling short of meeting the recommendations for vegetables, fruit, whole grains, dairy, and seafood and consume well over the recommended amount for refined grains. Meanwhile, many Americans also exceed the recommended limits for added sugars, saturated fats, sodium, and alcohol. Shifting towards more nutrient-dense choices, as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines, can help balance caloric intake and better meet nutrient needs for optimal health. In addition, evidence-based guidelines for obesity emphasize the importance of an individualized eating approach that is culturally acceptable, affordable, and prioritizes individual preferences to promote long-term adherence.24\nFigure 7.26. This graph indicates the percentage of the U.S. population ages 1 year and older with intakes below the recommendation or above the limit for different food groups and dietary components.",

    "content": "The other part of the energy balance equation is physical activity. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provide evidence-based guidelines for appropriate physical activity levels. These guidelines provide recommendations to Americans aged three and older about how to improve health and reduce chronic disease risk through physical activity. Increased physical activity has been found to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, some forms of cancer, falls and fractures, depression, and early death. Increased physical activity not only reduces disease risk but also improves overall health by increasing cardiovascular and muscular fitness, increasing bone density and strength, improving cognitive function, and assisting in weight loss and weight maintenance.25 In addition, physical activity has been shown to improve mood disorders, body image, and overall health-related quality of life.26 These benefits of physical activity can help counter some of the potential effects of carrying excess weight, and some research suggests that increasing physical activity and fitness levels is more effective than weight loss when it comes to reducing the risk of heart disease and premature death.26 To be most effective, individuals should find activities they enjoy so they can sustain their activity level for lifelong health.27\nKey guidelines for physical activity are summarized in Unit 10: Essential Elements and Benefits of Physical Fitness, but a few worth mentioning specific to weight include the following:\n* For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity.\n* Engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity per week can result in additional health benefits and may help with weight loss and weight loss maintenance.\n* Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of at least moderate intensity that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days per week, as these activities provide additional health benefits and promote weight maintenance. Exercises such as push-ups, sit-ups, squats, and lifting weights are all examples of muscle-strengthening activities.\nDespite the indisputable benefits of regular physical activity, just 23 percent of Americans met the national physical activity guidelines in 2018, although this number has gradually increased over the last several decades.28 Given the number of Americans that are falling short on both nutrition and physical activity recommendations, both of these areas are of primary interest in improving health in the United States.",

It is more than helping people to decide what to change; it is helping them identify how to change.\u201d29 Cornerstones for these interventions typically include self-monitoring through daily recording of food intake and exercise, nutrition education and dietary changes, physical activity goals, and behavior modification.30 Research shows that these types of interventions can result in weight loss and a lower risk for type 2 diabetes, and similar maintenance strategies lead to less weight regained later.31\nBehavioral interventions have been shown to help individuals achieve and maintain weight loss of at least 5 percent from baseline weight. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers a 5 percent weight loss to be clinically significant, as this level of weight loss has been shown to improve cardiometabolic risk factors such as blood lipid levels and insulin sensitivity.32,33 The behavioral intervention team often includes primary care clinicians, dietitians, psychologists, behavioral therapists, exercise physiologists, and lifestyle coaches.32 These programs may include a variety of delivery methods, often through group classes of 10-20 participants both in-person and online, and may use print-based or technology-based materials and resources. The interventions usually span one to two years with more frequent contact in the initial months (weekly to bi-monthly), followed by less frequent contact (monthly) in the latter months or maintenance phase.32 A variety of behavioral topics are covered over the course of the program and range from nutrition education and goal-setting, to problem-solving and assertiveness. Relapse prevention is included as participants move into the maintenance phase.31\nFig. 7.27. Common topics included in behavioral interventions for weight loss, adapted from Smith, C. E., & Wing, R. R. (2000). New directions in behavioral weight-loss programs. Diabetes Spectrum, 13(3), 142-148.\nOne example of a comprehensive behavior intervention is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). This was a high quality randomized controlled trial that enrolled participants at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes and included an intervention group that made dietary and physical activity changes with the support of frequent meetings with researchers to implement behavioral changes. In the DPP study, participants lost an average of 15 pounds and reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent in the first year. They gradually regained an average of 10 pounds by 10 years later. However, 10 years after the start of the study, intervention participants still had a 34 percent reduced risk in developing type 2 diabetes, indicating significant health benefits of the program.33\nThe DPP yielded such significant improvements in risk of developing diabetes that it was expanded to a national program available in communities throughout the U.S. To find a DPP intervention program near you, visit the National Diabetes Prevention Program website.",

    "content": "In addition to weight management approaches that focus on dietary changes, physical activity programs, and behavioral interventions, there is a growing movement for non-diet approaches for a healthier mentality toward weight, food, and body image. These approaches focus on establishing healthier relationships with food and more body acceptance and positivity regardless of shape and size. They seek to normalize relationships with food, make eating an enjoyable experience focused on well-being rather than dieting, do away with shame or guilt often associated with failed weight loss efforts, and promote respect and inclusivity for all people regardless of weight or size. Mindful eating or intuitive eating are common components of these approaches. These non-diet approaches have been shown to improve quality of life, general well-being, body image, cardiovascular outcomes, physical activity, and eating behaviors regardless of changes in weight status.24\nOne of these non-diet approaches, the Satter Eating Competence Model, is based on four components: eating attitudes, food acceptance, regulation of food intake and body weight, and management of the eating context. According to Ellyn Satter, a registered dietitian, family therapist, and the founder of the model, competent eaters are \u201cconfident, comfortable, and flexible with eating and are matter-of-fact and reliable about getting enough to eat of enjoyable and nourishing food.\u201d This approach enhances \u201cthe importance of eating by making it positive, joyful, and intrinsically rewarding.\u201d36 This model emphasizes that by developing a healthier relationship with food, individuals will yield the following benefits:37\n* Have better diets\n* Feel more positive about food and eating\n* Have better overall health\n* Have the same or lower BMI\n* Sleep better\n* Be more active\n* Have better physical self-acceptance\n* Be more trusting of themselves and others\nHealth at Every Size (HAES) is another non-diet movement started by the Association for Size Diversity and Health (ASDAH) organization as an alternative to weight-centered health models. HAES aims to decrease our culture\u2019s obsession with body size and weight, decrease weight discrimination and stigma, and instead promote size acceptance and inclusivity.38 Key principles of the HAES approach include:\n* Acceptance and respect for the inherent diversity of body shapes and sizes\n* Health enhancement through policies and services that promote well-being in all aspects of health, including physical, economic, social, emotional, and spiritual needs\n* Respectful care and elimination of weight bias and discrimination through proper education and training\n* Eating behaviors driven by hunger, satiety, nutritional needs, and pleasure instead of external regulation by diets and eating plans\n* Physical activity through life-enhancing movement for all sizes and abilities\nTo learn more about non-dieting approaches for a healthy lifestyle, check out the following video.\nVIDEO: \u201cWhy Dieting Doesn\u2019t Usually Work,\u201d from TED, 12:30 minutes.\nIt\u2019s clear that obesity is a complex disease that must be managed through a focus on overall health and well-being, not just by changing a number on the scale. Issues around weight bias and stigma must be addressed. Our current health system must improve to support individuals regardless of body shape and size. And current cultural narratives around obesity must change to remove assumptions of weakness or lack of willpower as causes of obesity and eliminate attitudes that cast blame and shame on people living with obesity.24",

    "content": "Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients, and by definition, they make up a relatively small part of our diet. However, when it comes to vitamins and minerals, a little bit goes a long way. They have many essential jobs in our bodies.\nFor example, if you\u2019ve taken a drink of water today, you can thank the minerals that serve as electrolytes, helping to balance fluids in the body. If you\u2019ve taken a breath of air, you can thank the vitamins and minerals that act as antioxidants, protecting vital molecules from free radical damage. If you\u2019ve taken a step, you can thank the vitamin D, calcium, and other minerals that make your bones strong. If you\u2019ve moved a muscle, you can thank the many vitamins and minerals that serve as cofactors in metabolic reactions, which unlock the energy contained in nutrients so that your body can use it.\nThere are some 13 vitamins and 16 minerals important to human nutrition, and each serves multiple functions in the body. Entire books have been written about each one, and we could easily spend a whole term learning about all of these amazing nutrients. But as this is an introductory course, we\u2019ll use the next two units to introduce you to some of the most interesting vitamins and minerals, with a focus on those that are commonly limiting in the human diet.\nWe\u2019ll begin this unit with a general introduction to vitamins and minerals, and we\u2019ll consider the role of dietary supplements in meeting our vitamin and mineral requirements. Then, we\u2019ll spend the remainder of this unit and the next exploring major functions of vitamins and minerals, where we find them in food, and what happens if we consume too little or too much of each.",

    "content": "Vitamins\u00a0are essential, non-caloric, organic micronutrients. There is energy contained in the chemical bonds of vitamin molecules, but our bodies don\u2019t make the enzymes to break these bonds and release their energy; instead, vitamins serve other essential functions in the body. Vitamins are traditionally categorized into two groups: water-soluble or fat-soluble. Whether vitamins are water-soluble or fat-soluble can affect their functions and sites of action. For example, water-soluble vitamins often act in the cytosol of cells (the fluid inside of cells) or in extracellular fluids such as blood, while fat-soluble vitamins play roles such as protecting cell membranes from free radical damage or acting within the cell\u2019s nucleus to influence gene expression.\nFigure 8.1. Classification of vitamins as water-soluble or fat-soluble.\nOne major difference between water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins is the way they are absorbed in the body. Water-soluble vitamins are absorbed directly from the small intestine into the bloodstream. Fat-soluble vitamins are first incorporated into chylomicrons, along with fatty acids, and transported through the lymphatic system to the bloodstream and then on to the liver. The bioavailability\u00a0(i.e., the amount that gets absorbed) of these vitamins is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Because fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat, if a meal is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins in that meal may be impaired.\nFigure 8.2. \u201cAbsorption of Fat-Soluble and Water-Soluble Vitamins.\u201d\nFat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins also differ in how they are stored in the body. The fat-soluble vitamins\u2014vitamins A, D, E, and K\u2014can be stored in the liver and the fatty tissues of the body. The ability to store these vitamins allows the body to draw on these stores when dietary intake is low, so deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins may take months to develop as the body stores become depleted. On the flip side, the body\u2019s storage capacity for fat-soluble vitamins increases the risk for toxicity. While toxic levels are typically only achieved through vitamin supplements, if large quantities of fat-soluble vitamins are consumed, either through foods or supplements, vitamin levels can build up in the liver and fatty tissues, leading to symptoms of toxicity.\nThere is limited storage capacity in the body for water-soluble vitamins, thus making it important to consume these vitamins on a daily basis. Deficiency of water-soluble vitamins is more common than fat-soluble vitamin deficiency because of this lack of storage. That also means toxicity of water-soluble vitamins is rare. Because of their solubility in water, intake of these vitamins in amounts above what is needed by the body can, to some extent, be excreted in the urine, leading to a lower risk of toxicity. Similar to fat-soluble vitamins, a toxic intake of water-soluble vitamins is not common through food sources, but is most frequently seen due to supplement use.\n| Characteristics of Fat-Soluble Vitamins | Characteristics of Water-Soluble Vitamins |\n| --- | --- |\n| Protect cell membranes from free radical damage; act within the cell\u2019s nucleus to influence gene expression | Act in the cytosol of cells or in extracellular fluids such as blood |\n| Absorbed into lymph with fats from foods | Absorbed directly into blood |\n| Large storage capacity in fatty tissues | Little to no storage capacity |\n| Do not need to be consumed daily to prevent deficiency (may take months to develop) | Need to be consumed regularly to prevent deficiency |\n| Toxicity is more likely | Toxicity is rare |\n|  |  |\nTable 8.1.

Minerals are abundant in our everyday lives. From the soil in your front yard to the jewelry you wear on your body, we interact with minerals constantly. Minerals\u00a0are inorganic elements in their simplest form, originating from the Earth. They can\u2019t be broken down or used as an energy source, but like vitamins, serve essential functions based on their individual characteristics. Living organisms can\u2019t make minerals, so the minerals our bodies need must come from the diet. Plants obtain minerals from the soil they grow in. Humans obtain minerals from eating plants, as well as indirectly from eating animal products (because the animal consumed minerals in the plants it ate). We also get minerals from the water we drink.

Major minerals are those that are required in the diet in amounts larger than 100 milligrams each day. These include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur. These major minerals can be found in many foods. While deficiencies are possible with minerals, consuming a varied diet significantly improves an individual\u2019s ability to meet their nutrient needs. We\u2019ll discuss the concern of both deficiencies and toxicities of specific minerals later in this unit.\nTrace minerals\u00a0are classified as minerals required in the diet in smaller amounts, specifically 100 milligrams or less per day. These include iron, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine, chromium, fluoride, manganese, and molybdenum. Although trace minerals are needed in smaller amounts, a deficiency of a trace mineral can be just as detrimental to your health as a major mineral deficiency.\nFigure 8.3. The classification of minerals as either major minerals or trace minerals.\nMinerals are water-soluble and do not require enzymatic digestion. They are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, although some minerals need the assistance of transport proteins for absorption and transport in blood.\nMinerals are not as efficiently absorbed as most vitamins, and many factors influence their bioavailability:\n* Minerals are generally better absorbed from animal-based foods. Plant-based foods often contain compounds that can bind to minerals and inhibit their absorption (e.g., oxalates, phytates).\n* In most cases, if dietary intake of a particular mineral is increased, absorption will decrease.\n* Some minerals influence the absorption of others. For instance, excess zinc in the diet can impair iron and copper absorption. Conversely, certain vitamins enhance mineral absorption. For example, vitamin C boosts iron absorption, and vitamin D boosts calcium and magnesium absorption.\n* As is the case with vitamins, mineral absorption can be impaired by certain gastrointestinal disorders and other diseases, such as Crohn\u2019s disease and kidney disease, as well as the aging process. Thus, people with malabsorption conditions and the elderly are at higher risk for mineral deficiencies.",

Each food group lends itself to specific vitamins and minerals (see Figure 8.4). Keep in mind that whole foods (e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy foods such as milk and cheese) contain more vitamins and minerals than their processed counterparts. A whole baked potato contains more vitamin C, folate, and potassium than a potato that is cut, soaked, and fried to make a french fry.\nFigure 8.4.

    "content": "The nutrient content of foods is typically highest when foods are allowed to ripen on the plant, allowing the plant to fully develop the nutrients and phytochemicals it needs to sustain life. Harvesting plants in the peak state of ripeness helps to ensure maximum vitamin and mineral content, and consuming freshly-picked or harvested produce usually maximizes how much of those nutrients make it into our bodies to be put to use by cells. But not all foods can be consumed immediately after harvest. How foods are handled, processed, stored, and prepared can impact how much of that peak nutrient level remains in the food.\nProcessing of food is an important step in our food supply. Harvesting and transporting foods to communities increases access to a variety of foods. Preservation techniques like canning and freezing extend the shelf life of foods and increase their availability outside of their peak harvest season. In fact, because fresh foods can deteriorate rapidly, food processing techniques may result in better nutrient retention over time when compared to fresh items. However, some vitamins are more stable than others, and the amount retained depends on the specific vitamin and the processing technique. Water-soluble vitamins are the most susceptible to the effects of processing, though other nutrients can be impacted as well.\n| Method of Processing | Effect on Nutrient Retention | How to Minimize Nutrient Loss |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Air exposure and time | Enzymes present in foods and exposure to air can destroy nutrients, because as soon as the food is harvested, the food begins to slowly decompose. | Purchase fresh items in quantities that can be used as soon as possible. Cut up foods only when ready to use. Buy local produce to cut back on transport time and air exposure. |\n| Temperature | Cooking helps kill bacteria, makes foods more appealing, and in some situations improves bioavailability of nutrients. But high temperatures for prolonged amounts of time can destroy some vitamins. | Use fast cooking methods like microwaving, steaming, or stir-frying. |\n| Water | Minerals and water-soluble vitamins can leach into the water. | Don\u2019t soak produce in water. Limit the amount of water used to cook foods (e.g., steam vegetables rather than boil them). Use cooking water in food preparation. |\n| Canning | High temperatures may be used, which can destroy water-soluble vitamins, but commercial techniques usually use rapid heating, which helps to reduce nutrient loss. | Choose a variety of canned goods that don\u2019t have added sugars or sodium to maximize nutrient density. |\n| Freezing | Freezing does not reduce nutrient content, but if foods are blanched prior to freezing it may slightly reduce levels of water-soluble vitamins. | Choose a variety of frozen goods that don\u2019t have added sugars, syrups, or sauces to maximize nutrient density. |\n| Refining of grains | Many B vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, as well as fiber, are lost when whole grains are refined. | Choose whole grains whenever possible. |\n|  |  |  |\nTable 8.2. The effects of processing on nutrient retention.1\nThere is a notable exception to the effects of processing described here. In contrast to most vitamins, the bioavailability of beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A, and similar phytochemicals called carotenoids is actually increased by the cooking process, because cooking, chopping, and homogenizing releases carotenoids from the plant matrix. Thus, cooked carrots can be a better source of vitamin A than raw carrots. However, overcooking transforms some of the carotenoids into inactive products, and in general it is best to chop and lightly steam vegetables containing carotenoids to maximize their availability from foods.",

In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) created new regulations for the labeling and safety of dietary supplements. Under these rules, the \u201cFDA is not authorized to review dietary supplement products for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed.\u201d3 Therefore, the responsibility falls on the manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements to ensure their products are safe before they go to consumers. The FDA has to prove that the product is unsafe in order to remove it from the market. This is a big contrast from pharmaceuticals, which must obtain approval from the FDA, showing substantial evidence that their drugs are safe and effective before reaching the marketplace.\nThe FDA issued Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for dietary supplements in 2007. GMPs are a set of requirements and expectations by which dietary supplements must be manufactured, prepared, and stored to ensure quality.4 Manufacturers are expected to guarantee the identity, purity, strength, and composition of their dietary supplements.4\nOnce a dietary supplement is on the market, the FDA tracks side effects reported by consumers, supplement companies, and others. If the FDA finds a product to be unsafe, it can take legal action against the manufacturer or distributor and may issue a warning or require that the product be removed from the marketplace. However, the FDA says it can\u2019t test all products marketed as dietary supplements that may have potentially harmful hidden ingredients.",

Unfortunately, manufacturers don\u2019t always have the public\u2019s best interest in mind, especially when there is a profit to be gained.\nAccording to the FDA website, the \u201cFDA has found that manufacturing problems have been associated with dietary supplements. Products have been recalled because of microbiological, pesticide, and heavy metal contamination and because they do not contain the dietary ingredients they are represented to contain or they contain more or less than the amount of the dietary ingredient claimed on the label.\u201d2\nWhat this means for consumers is that they should use caution when considering whether to use a dietary supplement. Keep in mind the following information from the Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health:1\n* What\u2019s on the label may not be what is in the product. For example, the FDA has found prescription drugs, including anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin), and others, in products being sold as dietary supplements. You can see a list of some of those products on the FDA\u2019s Tainted Supplements webpage.\n* Supplement labels may make illegal claims to make their product more appealing. A 2012 Government study of 127 dietary supplements marketed for weight loss or to support the immune system found that 20 percent made illegal claims.\n* Dietary supplements can interact with other medications, and cause harm. For example, the herbal supplement St. John\u2019s wort makes many medications less effective.\n* The term natural does not always mean safe. Ephedra, an evergreen plant native to central Asia is associated with heart problems and risk of death. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of ephedrine in dietary supplements for these reasons. Supplements can contain natural herbs and other plant-based ingredients that have not been adequately studied. We don\u2019t know if supplement ingredients are dangerous until people end up really sick or even die from them. Dietary supplements result in an estimated 23,000 emergency room visits every year in the United States, according to a 2015 study. Many of the patients are young adults having heart problems from weight-loss or energy products and older adults having swallowing problems from taking large vitamin pills.\n* The term \u201cstandardized\u201d (or \u201cverified\u201d or \u201ccertified\u201d) on a supplement does not always guarantee product quality or safety. These are terms used by manufacturers to sell their product and have not been legally defined.\nYou can report safety concerns about a dietary supplement through the U.S. Health and Human Services Safety Reporting Portal.

    "content": "The amount of scientific evidence on dietary supplements varies widely\u2014there is a lot of information on some and very little on others. The Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health offers these key points about efficacy of dietary supplements:1\n* Dietary supplements can\u2019t be marketed with claims that they can diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease; such claims would require the product to be approved by the FDA as a pharmaceutical. Instead, dietary supplements are marketed with health claims or structure/function claims, similar to claims on food labels. Recall from Unit 1 that structure/function claims (e.g., \u201cbuilds strong bones,\u201d or \u201cboosts immunity\u201d) are intentionally vague and require no evidence to support them. Supplements are often labeled with claims that have little to no scientific basis.\n* Studies have found that some dietary supplements may have benefits, such as melatonin for jet lag. Others may have little or no benefit, such as ginkgo for dementia.1 Many dietary supplements haven\u2019t been studied at all in humans.\n* Studies of many supplements haven\u2019t supported claims made about them. For example, in several studies, echinacea didn\u2019t help cure colds and Ginkgo biloba wasn\u2019t useful for dementia\u2014but you can still find Ginkgo biloba supplements with claims that they improve memory and echinacea supplements with claims of providing \u201cimmune support.\u201d Many times the research on a dietary supplement is conflicting, such as whether the supplements glucosamine and chondroitin improve symptoms of osteoarthritis.1 Research design and interpretation can also be biased when funded by the supplement industry.\n* Most research shows that taking multivitamin/mineral (MVM) supplements doesn\u2019t result in living longer, slowing cognitive decline, or lowering the chance of getting cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. However, taking a multivitamin is unlikely to pose health risks, providing you follow the guidelines below for choosing supplements.1",

    "content": "Throughout this text, we have discussed the importance of whole foods. As you might suspect, supplements can not replace real, whole food. Marion Nestle, professor emerita at New York University and author of many books about nutrition, wrote eloquently about the benefits of getting nutrients from food instead of supplements in a 2006 blog post:\n> \u201cUnless you have been diagnosed with a vitamin or mineral deficiency and need to replenish that nutrient in a great big hurry, it is always better to get nutrients from foods\u2014the way nature intended. I can think of three benefits of whole foods as compared to supplements: \n> \n> \n> (1) you get the full variety of nutrients\u2014vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc\u2013in that food, not just the one nutrient in the supplement; \n> \n> \n> (2) the amounts of the various nutrients are balanced so they don\u2019t interfere with each other\u2019s digestion, absorption, or metabolism; and \n> \n> \n> (3) there is no possibility of harm from taking nutrients from foods (OK. Polar bear liver is an exception; its level of vitamin A is toxic). \n> \n> \n> In contrast, high doses of single nutrients not only fail to improve health but also can make things worse, as has been shown in some clinical trials of the effects of beta-carotene, vitamin E, and folic acid, for example, on heart disease or cancer. And foods taste a whole lot better, of course.\u201d5\nHowever, there are certain populations that might be at risk for developing nutrient deficiencies, and they may benefit from a MVM supplement or supplements of specific nutrients. These groups include the elderly, strict vegetarians or vegans, people restricting their caloric intake, pregnant women, or individuals with food insecurity.6\nIf you choose to take supplements, keep moderation in mind, and use the following guidelines to help you choose a supplement.\n1. \u00a0Don\u2019t substitute for whole foods. According to the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, \u201cBecause foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods.\u201d7 Whole foods are complex and not only contain essential vitamins and minerals, but also dietary fiber and phytochemicals that may have positive health benefits. As their name suggests, supplements should never act as replacements for whole food, but rather as supplements to fill in some nutritional gaps.\n2. Check the dose carefully. Since dietary supplements are not regulated before they hit the market, it is not uncommon to find nutrient levels that exceed the upper intake level (UL). A good rule-of-thumb is to choose a supplement that keeps the dose close to 100% of the Daily Value (unless advised by a doctor to help correct a deficiency) and definitely no more than the UL.\n3. If getting supplements from multiple sources, make sure you add together the doses. Supplements not only come in pill form, but also powder and liquid form. Vitamin water, protein powder, and other products like Emergen-C are often fortified with large amounts of vitamins and minerals.\n4. Be skeptical of product claims. Remember that supplement manufacturers promote their products with structure/function claims, and they don\u2019t have to provide any evidence that the product actually does what it claims to do. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n5. Look for third-party testing when purchasing a supplement. ConsumerLab.com, NSF International, U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), and UL are all companies that do third-party testing on dietary supplements.8 If you see these companies\u2019 stamps (see Figure 8.5) on a supplement bottle, it means that the product is periodically tested to check that it:\n* + Contains the ingredients listed on the label, in the declared potency and amounts.\n\t+ Does not contain harmful levels of specified contaminants (e.g., heavy metals and pesticides).\n\t+ Will break down and release into the body within a specified amount of time.",

    "content": "Recall from Unit 1 that atoms are composed of a nucleus, which contains neutrons and protons, and electrons, which orbit the nucleus. Atoms are most stable when they have an even number of electrons, so that they can orbit the nucleus in pairs.\nAn atom or group of atoms with an unpaired electron is called a free radical. Free radicals are inherently unstable and highly reactive. They steal electrons from other molecules in order to stabilize themselves, but in doing so, they create additional free radicals. This electron-grabbing is called oxidation\u00a0and can set up a chain reaction, creating new free radicals and damaging important molecules along the way, similar to how one falling domino can bring down countless more.\nFigure 8.12. A free radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron. It can steal electrons from a stable molecule, creating a new free radical and initiating a chain reaction.\nAntioxidants\u00a0are molecules that can donate an electron to stabilize and neutralize free radicals. Like a domino that refuses to fall, an antioxidant can stop the free radical chain reaction in its tracks. In donating an electron, the antioxidant itself becomes a free radical. However, antioxidants are special in that they are not very reactive themselves and have processes for quick stabilization.\nFigure 8.13. Antioxidants stabilize free radicals by donating electrons, preventing the chain reaction that can create more free radicals. \nSome antioxidants are produced by the body, and some are consumed in the diet. Examples of dietary antioxidants include vitamins C and E, the mineral selenium, and phytochemicals, such as beta-carotene. We\u2019ll focus on vitamins C and E and selenium on this page, and we\u2019ll discuss beta-carotene on the next page.\nFree radicals are a natural byproduct of metabolic reactions and of exercise, and it\u2019s normal to have low levels of free radicals in the body. In fact, free radicals play a role in normal functioning of the body, including the ability to fight off pathogens and to send signals from one cell to another. And with enough antioxidants present, free radicals can be kept in check so that they aren\u2019t dangerous.1\nHowever, too many free radicals and not enough protection from antioxidants creates a situation called oxidative stress. Free radical-induced damage, when left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a contributing factor to cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and eye diseases such as cataracts.2\nSubstances and energy sources from the environment can add to or accelerate the production of free radicals within the body. Exposure to UV radiation (e.g., from sunlight), air pollution, tobacco smoke, heavy metals, ionizing radiation, asbestos, and other toxic chemicals increase the amount of free radicals in the body. They do so by being free radicals themselves or by adding energy that provokes electrons to move between atoms. Excessive exposure to environmental sources of free radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free radical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in repairing oxidative damage.\nOxidative stress is associated with the development of chronic diseases, and eating a diet rich in antioxidant-containing foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains seems to protect against many of these same diseases. It was thus natural for researchers to hypothesize that taking antioxidants in supplement form might also offer protection from these diseases. However, several decades of research investigating this hypothesis have revealed disappointing results. Not only have these studies shown that antioxidant supplements generally aren\u2019t beneficial, some have shown that they can cause health risks.",

It may come back to the fact that free radicals play important roles in the body, and adding high doses of antioxidant supplements overwhelms the normal balance of free radicals and does more harm than good. It may also be that the benefits of eating antioxidant-rich foods come not just from the antioxidants but from the entire package of nutrients, like fiber and phytochemicals in the whole foods, a combination that simply can\u2019t be replicated in a pill.

    "content": "When we talk about vitamin E, we\u2019re actually referring to 8 chemically similar substances, of which alpha-tocopherol appears to be the most potent antioxidant. Because vitamin E is fat-soluble, its antioxidant capacity is especially important to lipids, including those in cell membranes and lipoproteins. For example, free radicals can oxidize LDL cholesterol (stealing an electron from it), and it is this damaged LDL that lodges in blood vessels and forms the fatty plaques characteristic of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other complications of cardiovascular disease.\nAfter alpha-tocopherol interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of acting as an antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated. Vitamin C helps to regenerate some of the alpha-tocopherol, but the remainder is eliminated from the body. Therefore, to maintain vitamin E levels, you ingest it as part of your diet.\nIn addition to its antioxidant functions, vitamin E, mainly as alpha-tocopherol, plays a role in the immune system, regulation of gene expression, and cell signaling.

Vitamin C also plays a vital role in regenerating vitamin E after it has acted as an antioxidant, allowing it to be recycled and used again.\nFigure 8.15. After vitamin E donates an electron to neutralize a free radical, it can be regenerated by an electron from vitamin C. Vitamin C is then regenerated by antioxidant enzymes.\nIn addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is a required part of several enzymes involved in the synthesis of collagen, a protein important to the strength and structure of muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, connective tissue, and skin. Vitamin C is also required to synthesize neurotransmitters important for signaling in the brain, some hormones, and amino acids. It also plays a role in immune function and improves the absorption of dietary iron.\nThe body\u2019s vitamin C status is tightly controlled to maintain steady tissue and plasma concentrations. This means that if you consume high doses of vitamin C, you\u2019ll absorb less from the intestine and excrete more in urine to prevent excessive concentrations in the body. Vitamin C is not stored in any significant amount in the body, but once it has reduced a free radical, it is very effectively regenerated and therefore can exist in the body as a functioning antioxidant for many weeks.",

    "content": "The classic condition caused by vitamin C deficiency is scurvy. The signs and symptoms of scurvy include skin disorders, bleeding gums, joint pain, and weakness\u2014all of which may be related to vitamin C\u2019s role in collagen synthesis. Additional symptoms of scurvy include abnormally-thickened skin, fatigue, depression, iron deficiency anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections.\nIn the past, scurvy was common among sailors on long ocean voyages, whose diets were completely lacking in fruits and vegetables for many months. In the mid-1700s, British Navy surgeon Sir James Lind\u2019s experiments revealed that citrus fruits and juices could prevent scurvy in sailors. British sailors were often referred to as \u201climeys,\u201d as they carried sacks of limes onto ships to prevent scurvy. It was not until 1932 that scientists showed that vitamin C was the essential nutrient involved in this cure.\nFigure 8.17. This drawing of a sailor with scurvy, from the 1929 edition of \u201cKranken-Physiognomik\u201d by von K. H. Baumg\u00e4rtner, shows common effects of the disease, including sunken eyes and skin lesions.\nScurvy is prevented by even a low intake of fruits and vegetables, and it takes at least a month of consuming very little or no vitamin C for scurvy symptoms to develop. Thus, scurvy is rare in developed countries today. Diet surveys show that most Americans meet the RDA for vitamin C. When vitamin C deficiency occurs today, it is in people who consume very limited food variety, such as those with mental illness, people who abuse alcohol or drugs, people on very restrictive diets, and impoverished people with limited fruit and vegetable access. People who smoke also require more vitamin C to counter the free radicals generated by smoking.\nThe risk of vitamin C toxicity from foods is essentially nonexistent, because the body can adjust intestinal absorption and urinary excretion to maintain a healthy vitamin C level. However, high doses of vitamin C from supplements have been reported to cause numerous problems, including gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea. To prevent these discomforts, the UL for vitamin C is set at 2,000 milligrams per day for adults, more than twenty times the RDA.\nAt very high doses in combination with iron, vitamin C has sometimes been found to increase oxidative stress, reaffirming that getting your antioxidants from foods is better than getting them from supplements. There is also some evidence that taking vitamin C supplements at high doses increases the likelihood of developing kidney stones; however, this effect is most often observed in people that already have multiple risk factors for kidney stones.",

These typically contain doses in the range of 1000 mg of vitamin C, far higher than normal levels of vitamin C in the diet and enough to reach the UL of 2000 mg if a person takes two doses per day.\nDo these high-dose vitamin C supplements do anything to prevent or treat the misery of the common cold? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2013 by the Cochrane Collaboration summarized the results of 29 studies conducted on this question. The review concluded that for most people, these supplements don\u2019t prevent the common cold but can reduce the duration of symptoms by 8% in adults and 14% in children\u2014amounting to a day or two of relief\u2014but only if they\u2019re taken consistently every day and before cold symptoms begin.

(The percent of body water changes with development, because the proportions of muscle, fat, bone, and other tissues change from infancy to adulthood.) Of all the nutrients, water is the most critical, as its absence proves lethal within a few days. The importance of water in the human body can be loosely categorized into four basic functions: transportation vehicle, medium for chemical reactions, lubricant/shock absorber, and temperature regulator.\nMaintaining the right level of water in your body is crucial to survival, as either too little or too much will result in less-than-optimal functioning.

For example, sodium chloride (the chemical name for table salt) dissociates into sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl\u2212) in water.

    "content": "One of the essential homeostatic functions of the body is to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance within cells and their surrounding environment. Cell membranes are selectively permeable: Water can move freely through the cell membrane, while other substances, such as electrolytes, require special transport proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water between the intracellular and extracellular fluid happens by osmosis, which is simply the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane from an area where solutes are less concentrated to an area where solutes are more concentrated (Figure 8.7).\nFigure 8.7. Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semipermeable membrane towards higher solute concentration. If a membrane is permeable to water but not a solute, water will equalize its own concentration by diffusing to the side of lower water concentration (and thus the side of higher solute concentration). In the beaker on the left, the solution on the right side of the membrane is more concentrated with solutes; therefore, water diffuses to the right side of the beaker to equalize its concentration.\nTo maintain water and electrolyte balance, cells control the movement of electrolytes across their membranes, and water follows the electrolytes by osmosis. The health of the cell depends on proper fluid and electrolyte balance. If the body\u2019s fluid and electrolyte levels change too rapidly, cells can struggle to correct the imbalance quickly enough. For example, consider a person exercising strenuously, losing water and electrolytes in the form of sweat, and drinking excessive amounts of water. The excess water dilutes the sodium in the blood, leading to hyponatremia, or low blood sodium concentrations. Sodium levels within the cells are now more concentrated, leading water to enter the cells by osmosis. As a result, the cells swell with water and can burst if the imbalance is severe and prolonged.\nIn contrast, the opposite situation can occur in a person exercising strenuously for a long duration with inadequate fluid intake. This can lead to dehydration and hypernatremia, or elevated blood sodium levels. The high concentration of sodium in the extracellular fluid causes water to leave cells by osmosis, making them shrink (Figure 8.8). This scenario can also occur anytime a person is dehydrated because of significant fluid loss, such as from diarrhea and/or vomiting caused by illness.\nWhen a person becomes dehydrated, and solutes like sodium become too concentrated in the blood, the thirst response is triggered. Sensory receptors in the thirst center in the hypothalamus monitor the concentration of solutes of the blood. If blood solutes (like sodium) increase above ideal levels, the hypothalamus transmits signals that result in a conscious awareness of thirst. The hypothalamus also communicates to the kidneys to decrease water output through the urine.\nFigure 8.8. Effect of fluid imbalance on cells. With dehydration, the concentration of electrolytes becomes greater outside of cells, leading to water leaving cells and making them shrink. In fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations are in balance inside and outside of cells, so water is in balance too. During overhydration, electrolyte concentrations are low outside the cell relative to inside the cell (like in the situation of hyponatremia), so water moves into the cells, making them swell.\nThe cell is able to control the movement of the two major cations, sodium and potassium, with a sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+ pump). This pump transports sodium out of cells while moving potassium into cells.\nFigure 8.9. The sodium-potassium pump is found in many cell (plasma) membranes. Powered by ATP, the pump moves sodium and potassium ions in opposite directions, each against its concentration gradient.",

When a nerve cell is stimulated (e.g., the touch of a hand), there is an influx of sodium ions into the nerve cell. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium current moves along a nerve cell.\nStimulating a muscle contraction also involves the movement of sodium ions. For a muscle to contract, a nerve impulse travels to a muscle. The movement of the sodium current in the nerve signals the muscle cell membrane to open and sodium rushes in, creating another current that travels along the muscle and eventually leading to muscle contraction. In both nerve and muscle cells, the sodium that went in during a stimulus now has to be moved out by the sodium-potassium pump in order for the nerve and muscle cell to be stimulated again..",

However, studies have shown that this isn\u2019t always the case. According to Harvard Medical School, \u201cAbout 60% of people with high blood pressure are thought to be salt-sensitive\u00a0\u2014 [a trait that means your blood pressure increases with a high-sodium diet]. So are about a quarter of people with normal blood pressure, although they may develop high blood pressure later, since salt sensitivity increases with age and weight gain.\u201d2 Genetics, race, sex, weight, and physical activity level are determinants of salt sensitivity. African Americans, women, and overweight individuals are more salt-sensitive than others.\nThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is an eating pattern that has been tested in randomized controlled trials and shown to reduce blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels, resulting in decreased cardiovascular disease risk. The DASH plan recommends focusing on eating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, as well as including fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils; together, these foods provide a diet rich in key nutrients, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber, and protein. DASH also recommends limiting foods high in saturated fat (e.g., fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut or palm oils), sugar-sweetened beverages, and sweets. DASH also suggests consuming no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day and notes that reduction to 1,500 mg of sodium per day has been shown to further lower blood pressure.1\nAlthough the updated dietary reference intake (DRI) for sodium does not include an upper intake level (UL), the updated adequate intake (AI) considers chronic disease risk.3 There is a high strength of evidence that reducing sodium intake reduces blood pressure and therefore reduces cardiovascular disease risk.4",

    "content": "Vitamin A is a generic term for a group of similar compounds called retinoids. Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived foods, and it is converted in the body to the biologically active forms of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid. The dietary retinol found in animal-derived foods is called preformed or active vitamin A.\u00a0\nThis differentiates it from beta-carotene and other carotenoid compounds, which are brightly-colored yellow, orange, and red pigments synthesized by plants. These are called provitamin\u00a0A carotenoids, because they can be converted to vitamin A in the body. Among the carotenoids, beta-carotene is most efficiently converted to vitamin A. If you look at the beta-carotene molecule, you can see that it looks like two retinol molecules connected together. Enzymes in the intestine and liver can cleave the beta-carotene molecule in half, creating two new molecules of vitamin A.\nFigure 8.19. One molecule of beta-carotene can be enzymatically cleaved to 2 molecules of vitamin A.\nAs with other fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin A is packaged into chylomicrons in the enterocytes of the small intestine and then transported to the liver. The liver stores and exports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a retinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells. Beta-carotene can be converted into vitamin A in the intestine, or it can be absorbed intact, packaged in chylomicrons, and then transported around the body in lipoproteins. Beta-carotene and other carotenoids that aren\u2019t converted to vitamin A can also act as powerful antioxidants and have other helpful functions in the body, which may in part explain the health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.\nThe retinoids are aptly named, as their most notable function is in the retina of the eye. Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used as part of the pigment rhodopsin. Rhodopsin is especially important to our ability to see in low-light conditions. When light hits rhodopsin in the eye, a nerve signal is sent to the brain, allowing us to detect that light. A person that is deficient in vitamin A has less rhodopsin pigment in the eye and is therefore less able to detect low-level light. This makes it more difficult to see at night, a condition referred to as night blindness, and this is one of the first signs that a person is deficient in vitamin A.\nFigure 8.20. A depiction of the vision of a person suffering from night blindness, in which there is inadequate rhodopsin for detection of light. \nVitamin A is also required for normal cellular differentiation, the process by which cells change from stem cells to more specialized cells with specific structure and function. Cellular differentiation is important in every tissue of the body, but if there is a shortage of vitamin A, the eye is one of the first areas to be impacted. Specialized cells in the lining of the eyes produce mucus and tears, which keep eyes moist and lubricated. When the mucus-secreting cells die, they need to be replaced with new cells. If the body is deficient in vitamin A, those new cells don\u2019t differentiate normally, resulting in dry eyes, a condition called xerophthalmia. Instead of producing mucus, these dysfunctional cells produce a protein called keratin. Keratin\u00a0is a hard, structural protein that is found in nails, hair, and the outer layer of skin, and you can imagine the problems it causes when it accumulates in the eye. Instead of a moist, well-lubricated eye, keratin makes the eye hard and dry, resulting in clouded vision.\nFigure 8.21. A child with xerophthalmia caused by vitamin A deficiency, demonstrating cloudiness on the surface of the eye.\nA deficiency in vitamin A can thus impair vision in two ways:\n1. Development of night blindness due to a lack of the pigment rhodopsin\n2.",

If the deficiency persists, the damage from keratin in the lining of the eye can cause permanent blindness.\nVitamin A\u2019s role in cellular differentiation also makes it critical to cells around the body involved in normal growth, development, reproduction, and immune function. All of these processes require cells to develop in specific ways at specific times, and vitamin A helps to orchestrate these processes. For example, embryonic development requires stem cells to differentiate into specific types of cells to form new organs, and timing is critical.\nVitamin A also helps the immune system produce different types of immune cells, and without adequate vitamin A, a person is more susceptible to infections. The common occurrence of severe xerophthalmia in children who died from infectious diseases led scientists to hypothesize that supplementing vitamin A in the diets of children with xerophthalmia might reduce disease-related mortality. In Asia in the late 1980s, researchers administered vitamin A supplements to targeted populations of children, and their death rates from measles and diarrhea declined by up to 50%. Vitamin A supplementation in these deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the diseases so that they were less likely to be fatal. Since this discovery, providing vitamin A supplementation to children in the developing world has been a major effort of the World Health Organization and UNICEF.1.",

    "content": "The main symptoms of vitamin A deficiency are xerophthalmia, night blindness, and increased susceptibility to infections. Another symptom is hyperkeratosis, which occurs when cells in the skin overproduce the protein keratin (similar to what happens in the eye with xerophthalmia) causing the skin to become rough and irritated.\nVitamin A deficiency is rare in developed countries, but globally, it is the leading cause of preventable blindness in children. It is caused by malnutrition related to consumption of inadequate diets predominantly based on staple grains and lacking in animal products, fruits, vegetables, and fat, which increases absorption of vitamin A. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children lose their sight each year due to vitamin A deficiency, and half of them die within a year of developing blindness, likely due to infection.2 According to UNICEF, 30% of children under 5 have vitamin A deficiency in the world, but rates are as high as 44% and 48% in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, respectively.4\nFigure 8.23. The worldwide prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in 1995-2005, based on World Health Organization data. \nVitamin A toxicity causes dry, itchy skin, loss of appetite, dizziness, nausea, swelling of the brain, and joint pain. In the most severe cases, it can cause liver damage, coma, and death. Vitamin A toxicity is almost always caused by taking supplements in doses above the UL of 3,000 micrograms per day for substantial periods. These high doses would not be found in a normal diet, although vitamin A toxicity has been observed in Arctic explorers who ate large amounts of bear and seal liver.4 \nConsuming excessive amounts of vitamin A during pregnancy can also cause birth defects, so pregnant people should pay close attention to vitamin A contained in supplements. In addition, some synthetic forms of vitamin A (Retin-A and Accutane, for example) are used as acne treatments and should never be used during pregnancy due to the risk of birth defects.\nUnlike preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene and other carotenoids do not seem to cause birth defects or other major toxicity effects in high doses. This is because the body doesn\u2019t convert beta-carotene to vitamin A if it already has excessive amounts of vitamin A. Because it doesn\u2019t cause toxicity, beta-carotene is usually used as the source of vitamin A in prenatal multivitamin supplements.\nBeta-carotene that isn\u2019t converted to vitamin A is absorbed intact in the intestine. When high levels of beta-carotene are consumed in the diet, it can have the unusual effect of making a person\u2019s skin appear to be yellow or orange. The color change doesn\u2019t seem to be harmful, and normal skin tone returns once the person stops consuming so much beta-carotene. However, studies have shown that long-term consumption of high-dose beta-carotene supplements have been linked to increased rates of cancer and death, so it\u2019s best to get beta-carotene from food rather than supplements.",

The combination of collagen and minerals makes bone both flexible and strong, which allows it to withstand stress.\nMost bones contain two types of tissue, compact and spongy tissue, but their distribution and concentration vary based on the bone\u2019s function. Spongy bone (also known as trabecular bone) is 50 to 90 percent porous and appears as a lattice-like structure under a microscope. It makes up about 20 percent of the adult skeleton and is found at the ends of long bones, in the cores of vertebrae, and in the pelvis, as it supports shifts in weight distribution.\u00a0Compact bone\u00a0(also known as cortical bone) is dense so that it can withstand compressive forces. It is only 10 percent porous, and it looks similar to the rings in a tree trunk, with many concentric circles sandwiched together. Compact bone tissue makes up approximately 80 percent of the adult skeleton and surrounds all spongy tissue.\nFigure 9.1.

    "content": "Bones change in shape, size, and position throughout the life cycle. During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, bones are continuously growing and changing shape through two processes: growth (or ossification) and modeling. In the process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built up at a different site, which influences the shape of the bone. During childhood and adolescence, more bone is deposited than dismantled, so bones grow in both size and density, reaching 90 percent of peak bone mass by age 18 in girls and age 20 in boys.2 Peak bone mass\u00a0is reached by age 30, at which point bones have reached their maximum strength and density. Factors affecting peak bone mass include sex, race, hormones (e.g., estrogen and testosterone), nutrition (e.g., calcium and vitamin D intake), physical activity, and behavioral factors like smoking. These factors will be discussed in more detail when we discuss osteoporosis.\nIn adulthood, our bones stop growing and modeling, but they continue to go through a process of bone remodeling, in which bone tissue is degraded and built up at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting upon them, even in adulthood. This is why physical activity increases bone strength, especially when it involves weight-bearing activities. For example, tennis players can have measurably higher bone mass in the arm they use for play compared with the other arm.3 Ultimately, bones adapt their shape and size to accommodate function.\nThe dynamic nature of bone means that new tissue is constantly formed, and old, injured, or unnecessary bone is dissolved for repair or for calcium release. The cell type responsible for bone resorption, or breakdown, is the osteoclast. Osteoclasts are continually breaking down old bone tissue. Another type of cell, called osteoblasts, are continually forming new bone. The ongoing balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is responsible for the constant but subtle reshaping of bone. The decline in bone mass after age 40 occurs because the rate of bone loss is greater than the rate of bone formation. This means that osteoclast-mediated bone degradation exceeds that of the bone-building activity of osteoblasts. How much bone is lost in adulthood depends on peak bone mass reached in early adulthood and other risk factors, as we\u2019ll discuss next.",

    "content": "Osteoporosis\u00a0is a bone disease that occurs when bone density or bone mass decreases. The bone becomes thinner and more porous and is therefore more susceptible to breaking. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, more than 53 million people in the U.S. either have osteoporosis already or are at high risk of developing it due to low bone mass.1\nFigure 9.2. Osteoporosis. This illustration shows the difference between the structure of normal bone, which is less porous, and bone with osteoporosis, which is more porous. The two circles located on the spine and hip represent the location of the images.\nBone loss usually occurs without symptoms, so osteoporosis is often called a silent disease. It can go undetected until bones become so weak that they fracture due to a sudden strain, bump, or fall.\nOne way bone health can be assessed is by measuring bone mineral density. A bone mineral density (BMD) test can detect osteoporosis and predict the risk of bone fracture. The most common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. This method can measure bone density over the entire body, but most often the DXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of overall bone strength and health. DXA is painless, non-invasive, uses low doses of radiation, and is the most accurate way to measure BMD.\nAn individual\u2019s chances of developing osteoporosis depend on several risk factors, some of which are controllable and some of which are not. It is thought that genetic factors (such as sex and race) may account for up to 75 percent of bone mass, and lifestyle factors (such as diet and exercise habits) account for the remaining 25 percent.2\nOsteoporosis risk factors that are biological and can\u2019t be controlled:\n* Body frame size- People with small frames are at higher risk for osteoporosis.\n* Race- Caucasian and Asian populations are at higher risk of osteoporosis compared to African American and Hispanic populations, which are at lower risk.1\n* Family history\u2013 Having a family member with osteoporosis may increase risk, as heredity seems to play a part in the development of osteoporosis.\n* Age- After age 40, bone mass declines due to bone breakdown exceeding bone formation. Therefore, any person over the age of 40 has an increased likelihood of developing osteoporosis compared with a younger person. Starting out with a higher peak bone mass in early adulthood enables you to lose more bone during the aging process and not develop osteoporosis.\n* Sex- Females, on average, have a lower peak bone mass compared with males (see Figure 9.3) and a much greater risk of developing osteoporosis, in part because of hormone levels.\n* Hormones- The female hormone estrogen and the male hormone testosterone both help to increase peak bone mass. Estrogen is the primary female reproductive hormone, and it stimulates bone building and reduces bone breakdown. When women go through menopause (usually around age 50), they experience a natural decline in estrogen levels, which accelerates bone loss and increases the risk of developing osteoporosis (Figure 9.3).\nFigure 9.3. Age and bone mass. Bone density peaks at about 30 years of age, and women lose bone mass more rapidly than men, particularly around menopause.\nRisk factors that can be controlled:\n* Physical inactivity- Physical inactivity lowers peak bone mass, decreases BMD at all ages, and is linked to an increase in fracture risk, especially in the elderly. Regular exercise can help individuals achieve greater peak bone mass, prevents bone loss for women and men age 30 and older, and maintains strength and balance to help prevent falls later in life.",

    "content": "The best activities for stimulating new bone are weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, hiking, and dancing, and resistance exercises like weight lifting.\n* Nutrition- Ensuring adequate nutrition is a key component in maintaining bone health. Having low dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D are strong risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Protein is also important during childhood and adolescence for proper bone development, and in older age to preserve bone mass.4\n* Smoking- Smoking cigarettes has long been known to correlate to a decrease in bone mass and an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. However, because people who smoke are more likely to be physically inactive and have poor diets, it is difficult to determine whether smoking itself causes osteoporosis. Smoking is also linked to earlier menopause, and therefore the increased risk of developing osteoporosis among female smokers may also be attributed, at least in part, to having reduced estrogen production at an earlier age. However, studies have also shown that tobacco smoke and nicotine can directly impact bone metabolism.5\n* Alcohol intake- Alcohol intake may also affect bone health, although this seems to depend on the amount consumed. Light to moderate alcohol intake (two drinks or less per day) has been shown in some studies to be associated with an increase in bone density and a decreased risk of developing osteoporosis. However, excessive alcohol intake is associated with decreased bone density and increased fracture risk, although this may be due in part to other lifestyle factors, such as poor diet and less physical activity.6\n* Being underweight- Being underweight significantly increases the risk of developing osteoporosis, because people who are underweight often have a smaller frame size and a lower peak bone mass. The most striking relationship between being underweight and bone health is seen in people with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is strongly correlated with low peak bone mass, and more than 50 percent of men and women who have this illness develop osteoporosis, often very early in life.\nThe changeable risk factors for osteoporosis provide ways for people to improve their bone health, even though some people may be genetically predisposed to the disease. Prevention of osteoporosis begins early in life since this is a critical time of bone growth. Eating a balanced diet that provides adequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, and protein is important for bone health throughout the life cycle. Participating in exercise such as walking, hiking, and weight lifting, and refraining from risky behaviors like smoking and excessive drinking are all behaviors that will help protect bones..",

    "content": "Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Most of the body\u2019s calcium\u2014more than 99% of it\u2014is stored in bone, where it\u2019s important for bone strength and structure. The remaining 1% of the body\u2019s calcium is found in the blood and soft tissues, but it is here that calcium performs its most critical functions. For example, calcium is required for the transmission of every nerve impulse, electrical signals sent from one nerve cell to another. It\u2019s also required for every cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. With inadequate calcium, muscles can\u2019t relax, and instead become stiff and contract involuntarily, a condition known as tetany. Calcium also plays vital roles in blood pressure regulation, blood clotting, enzyme activation, hormone secretion, and signaling between cells.1\nThe many roles of calcium around the body are critical to daily survival, so maintaining homeostasis, or a steady state, of blood calcium levels is a high priority. The body rigorously controls blood calcium levels in a very tight range. If blood calcium drops, your body initiates several mechanisms to restore homeostasis, including drawing calcium from the bone. While the calcium stored in bone is important for long-term strength and structure of bone, it also serves as a calcium reserve that can be drawn upon to support the vital functions of calcium in the body, should blood calcium drop too low.\nTwo endocrine glands are key players in the regulation of blood calcium concentrations: the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands. The thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. It secretes a hormone called calcitonin. There are four parathyroid glands, each about the size of a pea and located at the back of the thyroid gland. They secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).\nFigure 9.4. The thyroid and parathyroid glands are located at the back of the neck.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how the body regulates blood calcium levels. If the blood calcium concentration drops too low, the parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH then acts in several ways to increase blood calcium levels:\n1. PTH stimulates the activity of osteoclasts to release calcium from bone.\n2. PTH acts on the kidney to reduce the amount of calcium lost in the urine, returning more to circulation.\n3. PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that convert vitamin D to its active form, also called calcitriol. Activated vitamin D acts on the intestine to increase the absorption of calcium. Vitamin D also works together with PTH to stimulate release of calcium from the bone and reduce calcium loss in urine.\nOnce blood calcium levels are normal, PTH levels drop, turning off all of these mechanisms of increasing calcium.\nOn the other hand, if blood calcium levels become too high, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits the release of calcium from the bone and increases calcium excretion from the kidneys. These mechanisms help to restore normal blood calcium concentrations, after which calcitonin levels drop again.\nFigure 9.5. Blood calcium (Ca2+) levels are tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin.\nThrough these two opposing pathways\u2014PTH and vitamin D for raising blood calcium and calcitonin for lowering blood calcium\u2014the body can very effectively maintain blood calcium homeostasis. This system is dependent upon stored calcium in bone, which is sacrificed when needed to ensure adequate blood calcium. In the short-term, this isn\u2019t a problem, because bone remodeling allows you to replace calcium in the bone. However, in the long-term, inadequate dietary calcium means you continuously draw down the calcium stores in your bones, resulting in declining bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture.\nCalcium requirements are highest for children and adolescents, who are growing and building bones, and for older adults, who are losing bone density.",

Foods fortified with calcium such as cereals, soy milk and other plant-based beverages, and orange juice also provide one third or greater of the calcium RDA. Smaller amounts of calcium are naturally present in plant-based foods such as legumes, leafy greens, and nuts, and with careful planning, adequate calcium can be obtained from non-dairy sources.\nFigure 9.6. Dietary sources of calcium. Examples of good sources pictured include cheese, milk, fortified soymilk, yogurt (with almond granola), edamame, and chia seeds. Source: NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015-2020.\nCalcium bioavailability, or the amount of dietary calcium that is absorbed from the intestine into the bloodstream, can vary significantly. In general, calcium absorption is highest in infants and young children\u2014who need relatively high amounts of calcium for building bone\u2014and declines with age. With higher calcium intake, especially from supplements, bioavailability decreases in order to prevent excessive calcium absorption. Some chemical components of plant foods, including phytic acid (found in whole grains, beans, seeds, soy, and nuts) and oxalic acid (found in spinach, collard greens, sweet potatoes, rhubarb, and beans), bind to calcium and reduce bioavailability. Despite reduced absorption, these foods can still provide a significant amount of calcium.1",

If low blood calcium does occur, symptoms include muscle cramping, numbness and tingling in fingers, convulsions, lethargy, poor appetite, and abnormal heart rhythms. Without treatment, low blood calcium can lead to death.1\nMuch more common is a long-term calcium deficiency, resulting from a continuous draw of calcium stores from the bone. This causes osteopenia, or low bone mass, which can lead to osteoporosis if untreated. Osteoporosis significantly increases a person\u2019s risk of fractures. Nutrition surveys in the United States show that groups at greatest risk of dietary calcium inadequacy include adolescents and older adults, especially female teens and older women.1\nToo much calcium can also cause problems, although this is rarely caused by excessive intake of calcium from foods. Abnormally high activity of the parathyroid gland or a parathyroid tumor can cause high blood calcium, leading to calcification or hardening of blood vessels and soft tissue and the formation of kidney stones. High calcium intake from supplements has also been associated with increased risk of kidney stones, and in some studies, increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It can also cause constipation.1",

More studies are needed to determine whether magnesium supplements may help prevent these diseases. However, since magnesium is present in many healthful whole foods, improving magnesium intake through diet may bring multiple benefits.\nObvious magnesium deficiency due to low dietary intake is rare in healthy people, because the kidneys can decrease urinary excretion of this mineral when intake is inadequate. People at greater risk of magnesium deficiency include those with type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases like Crohn\u2019s and celiac, chronic alcoholism, and older adults. A magnesium deficiency can cause decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. If extreme, it can cause personality changes, muscle cramps, numbness, tingling, seizures, and an abnormal heart rhythm.3\nExcessive intake of magnesium from foods is not a risk, as the kidneys can effectively excrete it if it\u2019s in excess.

    "content": "Fluoride is a trace mineral needed in very small amounts in the body. It is known mostly as the mineral that combats tooth decay, but it also plays a role in assisting with tooth and bone development and maintenance. Because it isn\u2019t necessary for growth or to sustain life, fluoride is generally not considered an essential mineral. However, fluoride\u2019s role in preventing dental caries (i.e., tooth decay), the most prevalent chronic disease in children and adults, underscores the importance of this mineral in the human diet.4\nFluoride combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:\n* Blocking acid formation by bacteria\n* Preventing demineralization of teeth\n* Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel\nAs a natural mineral, fluoride is present in the soil and water in varying concentrations depending on geographical location. In the 1930s, researchers observed that children living in areas with naturally higher fluoride concentrations in their drinking water had a lower incidence of cavities, leading to the idea that adding fluoride to municipal water supplies could benefit public health. Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan; now over 60 percent of the U.S. population consumes drinking water that has been supplemented with fluoride to provide amounts that support dental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water reduces cavities by 25 percent in children and adults and considers water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements in the twentieth century.5\nFluoride\u2019s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but fluoride also plays an important role in the mineralization of bones, increasing their structural stability. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases bone mineral density in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis, mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known. It also has several side effects, including frequent stomach upset and joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much greater than that in fluoridated water.",

Other beverages with a high amount of fluoride include teas and grape juice. Solid foods do not generally contain a large amount of fluoride, although this depends on the fluoride level of the soil and water it was grown in and whether it was cooked with fluoridated water. Canned meats and fish that contain bones do contain some fluoride. Other good non-dietary sources are fluoridated toothpaste and dental rinses.\nFigure 9.9.

This connection is why so many water supplies are fluoridated.\nHowever, as with all minerals, fluoride can also be quite toxic if consumed in excessive amounts. Acute toxicity symptoms from large intakes of fluoride include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity results in an irreversible condition known as fluorosis, characterized by the mottling (i.e., white speckling) and pitting of the teeth (see Figure 9.10). Fluorosis is primarily a risk in children, because mineralization of permanent teeth has typically occurred by age 8.6\nFigure 9.10. A mild case of fluorosis (left) vs. a severe case of fluorosis (right).\nBecause fluoridated oral care products often taste good, making them appealing to young children, it is important to make sure infants and children do not consume too much fluoride by swallowing toothpaste or other oral care products. Recommendations for managing fluoride intake in children include the following:7-9\n* Do not use any fluoride supplement without talking to your health care provider.\n* Consider a prescription fluoride supplement for children who live in communities without fluoridated water or rely on a well water supply that is not fluoridated.\n* Use only a smear (rice-sized) amount of fluoride toothpaste as soon as the first tooth erupts in infants up through age 2 years.\n* Use only a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste in children ages 3 to 6 years.\n* Encourage children to spit out toothpaste instead of swallowing it.\n* Avoid fluoride mouth rinses in children younger than 6 years.",

    "content": "Vitamin D synthesis in the skin begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol. Then, in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol), which is transported to the liver by a binding protein.\nIn dietary sources, vitamin D may be present in the form of vitamin D3 from animal products or vitamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol), made by plants, mushrooms, and yeast. Dietary vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are transported to the liver via chylomicrons and then taken up in chylomicron remnants.\nVitamins D2 and D3 are both inactive until they undergo two hydroxylations\u2014chemical reactions that add a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The first hydroxylation occurs in the liver, creating calcidiol. This is the circulating form of vitamin D and the form measured in blood to assess a person\u2019s vitamin D status. The second hydroxylation occurs in the kidneys and forms calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\nRecall from our discussion of regulation of blood calcium that one of the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is to stimulate enzymes in the kidney that perform this last step in the activation of vitamin D. Active vitamin D increases the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus in the intestine, as well as working with PTH to reduce calcium loss in the urine and stimulate release of calcium and phosphorus from the bone. In these ways, vitamin D plays a critical role in both maintaining blood calcium homeostasis and enhancing the supply of calcium and phosphorus for bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in poor bone mineralization, with serious consequences in both children and adults, as we\u2019ll discuss later on this page.\nFigure 9.11. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin (vitamin D3) or provided in the diet (vitamin D2 or D3). It is converted by reactions occurring first in the liver (making calcidiol) and then kidney (making calcitriol, the active form). Once active, vitamin D works in several ways to ensure blood calcium homeostasis and enhance the availability of calcium for bone mineralization.\nBeyond its role in bone health, vitamin D has many other functions in the body. Cells throughout the body have vitamin D receptors in their nuclei, and by binding to these receptors, vitamin D is thought to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. Specifically, vitamin D is known to play important roles in regulating cellular differentiation and growth, immunity, insulin secretion, and blood pressure. Studies have found correlations between low circulating vitamin D levels and increased risks of chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, it has been difficult to determine if a lack of vitamin D actually contributes to the cause of these diseases, and research in this area is ongoing.1",

    "content": "In most people, vitamin D synthesis in the skin provides a significant portion of their body\u2019s needs, and a little sun exposure can go a long way. Vitamin D researchers suggest that most people need between 5 and 30 minutes of sun exposure between 10 AM and 3 PM, at least twice per week, in order to synthesize adequate vitamin D. However, any factor that decreases exposure to UV rays can interfere with vitamin D synthesis, including the following:2\n* Geographic latitude and season. Your location on Earth and the time of the year affects your exposure to UV radiation from the sun. Exposure to UV light is greatest at the equator and declines as you move further north or south. Likewise, in the summer months, the sun is directly overhead for a greater part of the day, so you have more opportunities to synthesize vitamin D. In the winter, the sun stays lower in the sky, day length is shorter, and cloud cover is more likely to block the sun\u2019s rays, all of which decrease opportunities to synthesize vitamin D. North of about 35 degrees latitude, vitamin D synthesis is inadequate for at least a few months during the winter, because the sun simply doesn\u2019t get high enough in the sky to provide enough UV radiation on earth\u2019s surface. For example, in Boston and at the California-Oregon border (42nd parallel north), vitamin D synthesis occurs only from March until October. However, in Los Angeles (34th parallel north), vitamin D synthesis occurs year round. Ozone and air pollution can also block UV rays and decrease vitamin D synthesis.\n* Skin pigmentation. Darker skin pigmentation, caused by greater melanin production in the skin, decreases UV light absorption. This helps to protect the skin from damage from UV radiation\u2014a helpful adaptation for those living closer to the equator\u2014but it also reduces synthesis of vitamin D. People with darker skin pigmentation need to spend more time in the sun in order to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D as lighter-skinned people.\n* Age. The efficiency of vitamin D synthesis declines with age. In addition, older adults often spend less time outside so may receive less exposure to sunlight.\n* Sun-protective behavior. While some UV light exposure is needed to synthesize vitamin D, UV radiation is also carcinogenic, and too much exposure increases the risk of skin cancer. It\u2019s wise to protect your skin from UV radiation by applying sunscreen, covering up with clothing and a hat, finding shade, and avoiding sun exposure in the middle of the day. People who are highly vigilant in these sun-protective behaviors or simply aren\u2019t able to go outside during the day (UV rays don\u2019t penetrate glass) may not get enough UV light for vitamin D synthesis.\nWith so many factors affecting UV radiation exposure, many people are unable to synthesize enough vitamin D for at least part of the year. Because vitamin D is fat-soluble, liver and adipose storage can supply the body for a while. Beyond that, dietary sources and supplements may be needed to meet the vitamin D requirement.2",

Vitamin D deficiency can also cause bone pain, as well as muscle weakness and pain, symptoms that can increase the risk of falling and fractures, particularly in older adults.2\nAlthough vitamin D toxicity is rare, taking excessive amounts of vitamin D in supplement form can lead to hypercalcemia, or high blood calcium. Hypercalcemia can cause kidney damage and calcium deposits to develop in soft tissues such as the kidneys, blood vessels, or other parts of the cardiovascular system.

A great analogy of this phenomenon is the gas in your car. Does it drive faster with a half-tank of gas or a full one? It does not matter; the car drives just as fast as long as it has gas. Similarly, depletion of B vitamins will cause problems in energy metabolism, but having more than is required to run metabolism does not speed it up.

Similarly, most of the minerals involved in energy metabolism and listed above are trace minerals that are not frequently deficient in the diet. However, when a deficiency of one of these vitamins or minerals does occur, symptoms can be seen throughout the body because of their relationship to energy metabolism, which happens in all cells of the body. A lack of these vitamins and minerals typically impairs blood health and the conversion of macronutrients into usable energy (i.e., ATP). Deficiency can also lead to an increase in susceptibility to infections, tiredness, lack of energy, and a decrease in concentration.1 Groups most at risk for a deficiency in any of these micronutrients are people on calorie-limited diets, people with imbalanced or insufficient nutrition, people with eating disorders, and people experiencing extensive levels of physical or emotional stress.1\nBecause of their water-solubility, toxicities of most of these nutrients are also uncommon, as excess intake is often excreted from the body. That doesn\u2019t mean taking high doses comes without risks. Large quantities, particularly through supplements, can lead to adverse side effects or cause interactions with medications. For example, too much niacin can cause flushing of the skin or dangerous drops in blood pressure, and a high intake of B6 can lead to neuropathy.

Therefore, rapidly dividing cells are most affected by folate deficiency. Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are continuously being synthesized in the bone marrow from dividing stem cells. When folate is deficient, cells cannot divide normally. A consequence of folate deficiency is macrocytic anemia. Macrocytic means \u201cbig cell,\u201d and anemia refers to fewer red blood cells or red blood cells containing less hemoglobin. Macrocytic anemia is characterized by larger and fewer red blood cells that are less efficient at carrying oxygen to cells. It is caused by red blood cells being unable to produce DNA and RNA fast enough\u2014cells grow but do not divide, making them large in size.\nFigure 9.15. Folate and the formation of macrocytic anemia.\nFolate is especially essential for the growth and specialization of cells of the central nervous system. Children whose mothers were folate-deficient during pregnancy have a higher risk of neural tube birth defects. Folate deficiency is causally linked to the development of spina bifida, a neural tube defect that occurs in a developing fetus when the spine does not completely enclose the spinal cord. Spina bifida can lead to many physical and mental disabilities (Figure 9.16). In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began requiring manufacturers to fortify enriched breads, cereals, flours, and cornmeal with folic acid (a synthetic form of folate) to increase the consumption of folate in the American diet and reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Observational studies show that the prevalence of neural tube defects was decreased after the fortification of enriched cereal and grain products with folate compared to before these products were fortified.\nFigure 9.16. Spina bifida (left) is a neural tube defect that can have serious health consequences. The prevalence of cases of spina bifida has decreased significantly with the fortification of cereal and grain products in the United States beginning in 1998.\nAdditionally, results of clinical trials have demonstrated that neural tube defects are significantly decreased in the offspring of mothers who began taking folic acid supplements one month prior to becoming pregnant and throughout pregnancy.

Other symptoms of folate deficiency can include mouth sores, gastrointestinal distress, and changes in the skin, hair and nails.

    "content": "Vitamin B12 is a unique vitamin because it contains an element (cobalt) and is found almost exclusively in animal products. Neither plants nor animals can synthesize vitamin B12; only bacteria can synthesize it. The vitamin B12 found in animal-derived foods was produced by microorganisms within the animals. Animals consume the microorganisms in soil, or microorganisms in the GI tract of animals produce vitamin B12 that can then be absorbed.\nVitamin B12 helps to prevent the breakdown of the myelin sheath, a cover that surrounds and protects nerve cells. It is also an essential part of coenzymes. It is necessary for fat and protein catabolism, folate coenzyme function, and hemoglobin synthesis. An enzyme requiring vitamin B12 is needed by a folate-dependent enzyme to synthesize DNA. Thus, a deficiency in vitamin B12 has similar consequences to health as a folate deficiency. In children and adults, vitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, and in babies born to cobalamin-deficient mothers there is an increased risk for neural tube defects.\nIn order for the human body to absorb vitamin B12, the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine must be functioning properly. Cells in the stomach secrete a protein called intrinsic factor\u00a0that is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption, which occurs in the small intestine. Impairment of secretion of this protein either caused by an autoimmune disease or by chronic inflammation of the stomach (such as that occurring in some people with H.pylori infection), can lead to the disease pernicious anemia, a type of macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B12 malabsorption is most common in older adults, who may have impaired functioning of digestive organs, a normal consequence of aging.\nVitamin B12 and folate play key roles in converting homocysteine, an amino acid found in the blood, to the amino acid methionine. High levels of homocysteine in the blood increases the risk for heart disease. Low levels of vitamin B12, folate, or vitamin B6 will increase homocysteine levels, thereby increasing the risk of heart disease.",

Although vitamin B12 is not generally present in plant foods, fortified breakfast cereals are also a good source of vitamin B12. Because vitamin B12 is only found primarily in animal products, it is important for strict vegetarians who consume no animal products (vegans) to get vitamin B12 either through supplements, nutritional yeast, or fortified products like cereals and soy milk. Recent research suggests some plant-based sources like edible algae, mushrooms, and fermented vegetables may contain substantial amounts of vitamin B12 as well.2\nFigure 9.18.

    "content": "When there is a deficiency in vitamin B12, inactive folate (from food) is unable to be converted to active folate and used in the body for the synthesis of DNA. However, folic acid from supplements or fortified foods is available to be used as active folate in the body without vitamin B12. Therefore, if there is a deficiency in vitamin B12, macrocytic anemia may occur. Vitamin B12 deficiency also results in nerve degeneration and abnormalities that can often precede the development of anemia. These include a decline in mental function and burning, tingling, and numbness of legs. These symptoms can continue to worsen, and deficiency can be fatal.4\nThe most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is the condition of inadequate intrinsic factor production that leads to poor vitamin B12 absorption, resulting in pernicious anemia. This condition is common in people over the age of 50, because production of intrinsic factor decreases with age. Pernicious anemia is treated by large oral doses of vitamin B12 or by putting the vitamin under the tongue (sublingual), where it is absorbed into the bloodstream without passing through the intestine. In patients that do not respond to oral or sublingual treatment, vitamin B12 is given by injection.\nBecause vitamin B12 is found primarily in foods of animal origin, a strict vegetarian diet can result in cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, careful dietary planning to include fortified sources or supplements of vitamin B12 is important to prevent deficiency in a vegan diet.\nNo toxicity of vitamin B12 has been reported. Because of the low risk for toxicity, a tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established for vitamin B12.4",

It is a necessary component of many proteins in the body responsible for functions such as the transport of oxygen, energy metabolism, immune function, and antioxidant defense. Iron is also important in brain development and function.\nIron is essential for oxygen transport because of its role in hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen to cells and gives red blood cells their color. Hemoglobin is composed of four globular peptides, each with an iron-containing heme complex in the center (Figure 9.19).\nFigure 9.19. The structure of hemoglobin and the heme complex. On the left, the structure of hemoglobin includes four globular peptides (shown in blue and red) and the iron-containing heme groups (shown in green). On the right is a closer view of the heme complex.\nThe iron in hemoglobin is what binds to oxygen, allowing for transportation to cells. If iron levels are low, hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts, and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced, resulting in anemia. Iron is also an important part of myoglobin, a protein similar to hemoglobin but found in muscles.",

    "content": "There are two types of iron found in foods: heme iron and non-heme iron.\n* Heme iron\u00a0is iron that is part of the proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin, so it is found only in foods of animal origin, such as meat, poultry, and fish. Heme iron is the most bioavailable form of iron. About 40% of the iron in animal foods is heme iron and 60% is non-heme iron.\n* Non-heme iron\u00a0is the mineral by itself and is not a part of hemoglobin or myoglobin. Non-heme iron can be found in foods from both plants (e.g., nuts, beans, vegetables, and fortified and whole grains) and animals. It is less bioavailable than heme iron. Consuming vitamin C, meat, poultry, and seafood with non-heme iron increases its bioavailability. For example, eating an orange ( a good source of vitamin C) along with your bowl of vegetarian chili will help you to absorb more of the iron from the beans and vegetables. On the other hand, chemicals such as phytates (found in beans and grains) and plant polyphenols (found in fruits, vegetables, some cereals, legumes, tea, coffee, and wine) decrease bioavailability due to binding with iron.1\nFigure 9.20. Dietary sources of iron. Examples of good sources pictured include fortified cereal, clams, spinach, lentils and red meat. Source: NIH Office of Dietary Supplements\nThe bioavailability of iron is approximately 14% to 18% from mixed diets and 5% to 12% from vegetarian diets.2  Bioavailability is influenced by the dietary factors previously mentioned, as well as iron status. The body has no physiological mechanism to excrete iron; therefore, iron balance is tightly regulated by absorption.2 When iron stores are low, more dietary iron will be absorbed.\nThe majority of the body\u2019s iron needs are not met by dietary sources, but rather by recycling iron within the body (endogenous sources). Ninety percent of daily iron needs are met by recycling iron released from the breakdown of aging cells, mostly red blood cells.2",

    "content": "Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies, affecting more than a third of the world\u2019s population.3 Iron-deficiency anemia\u00a0is a condition that develops from having insufficient iron levels in the body, resulting in fewer and smaller red blood cells that contain less hemoglobin. As a result, blood carries less oxygen from the lungs to cells. Iron-deficiency anemia has the following signs and symptoms, which are linked to the essential functions of iron in energy metabolism and blood health:\n* Fatigue\n* Weakness\n* Pale skin\n* Shortness of breath\n* Dizziness\n* Swollen, sore tongue\n* Abnormal heart rate\nInfants, children, adolescents, and women are the populations most at risk worldwide for iron-deficiency anemia.4 Infants who are premature, low birthweight, or have a mother with iron deficiency are at risk for iron deficiency, because they are born with low iron stores relative to the amount needed for growth and development. Young children and adolescent girls are at risk for iron deficiency due to rapid growth, low dietary intake of iron, as well as heavy menstruation for adolescent girls. In these populations, iron-deficiency anemia can also cause the following signs and symptoms: pica (an intense craving for and ingestion of non-food items such as paper, dirt, or clay), poor growth, failure to thrive, and poor performance in school, as well as mental, motor, and behavioral disorders. Women who experience heavy menstrual bleeding, or who are pregnant, are also at risk for iron inadequacy due to their increased requirements for iron.\nTo give you a better understanding of these risks, it is helpful to look at how much higher the RDA is for women of reproductive age and pregnant women compared to men (Table 9.2).1 To put this in perspective, 3 ounces of beef contains about 3 milligrams of iron, making it challenging for some women to meet their daily iron requirement.\n| Population Group | RDA for Iron |\n| --- | --- |\n| Women of reproductive age, 19-50 years | 18 mg/day |\n| Pregnancy, 19- 50 years | 27 mg/day |\n| Men, 19-50 years | 8 mg/day |\n|  |  |\nTable 9.2. A comparison of the RDAs for adult women of reproductive age, pregnancy, and adult men.\nAdditionally, those who frequently donate blood, as well as people with cancer, heart failure, or gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn\u2019s, are at greater risk for iron inadequacy.1\nIron deficiency progresses through three stages:1\n1. Mild depletion of iron stores \u2013 No physical symptoms will be present, because hemoglobin levels are not affected, but there will be a decrease in ferritin\u00a0(a storage form of iron).\n2. Iron-deficient erythropoiesis (erythrocyte or red blood cell production) \u2013 Iron stores are depleted and iron transport is decreased due to a decrease in transferrin\u00a0(the transport protein for iron), but hemoglobin levels are usually within the normal range.\n3. Iron-deficiency anemia \u2013 Iron stores are exhausted and hemoglobin levels are reduced, resulting in microcytic anemia (small red blood cells) and hypochromic anemia\u00a0(low color red blood cells).\nHealthy adults are at little risk of iron overload from foods, but too much iron from supplements can result in gastric upset, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.1 The body excretes little iron; therefore, the potential for toxicity from supplements is a concern. In children, death has occurred from ingesting as little as 200 mg of iron, so it is critical to keep iron supplements out of children\u2019s reach. The tolerable upper intake for iron is 45 mg per day for adults, based on the amount that causes gastrointestinal distress.1",

When there is damage to a blood vessel that results in bleeding, like a small tear, the body can stop this bleeding through a cascade of reactions. Without adequate vitamin K, blood does not clot properly, and this small bleed can turn into a larger problem, causing excessive bleeding or hemorrhage. People at risk are those who have malabsorption and other gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease. Newborns are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency during the first few months of life, as there is poor transfer of vitamin K across the placenta, and breastmilk is also low in vitamin K. Therefore, it has become a routine practice to inject newborns with a single intramuscular dose of vitamin K to prevent hemorrhaging, as bleeding within the skull is especially life-threatening.\nThe Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) has not established a UL for vitamin K because it has a low potential for toxicity.",

It keeps the heart and lungs strong, strengthens muscles and bones, helps to protect against chronic disease, improves brain and mental health, and can support healthy body weight. There are four main components of physical fitness as it relates to health and function: cardiorespiratory fitness, musculoskeletal fitness, flexibility, and balance. 1 Each component offers specific health benefits, but optimal health requires some degree of balance between all four. (Speed, or the ability to move the body quickly, is also considered a component of physical fitness, but it is less related to health and more relevant to competitive athletes.1)\nSome forms of exercise can help build multiple types of fitness. For example, riding a bicycle not only builds cardiorespiratory endurance; it can also improve muscle strength and endurance. Some forms of yoga and Pilates can also build muscle strength and endurance, along with flexibility and balance. However, building fitness in all four categories generally requires incorporating a range of activities into your regular routine.

Examples of aerobic activities include walking, running, swimming, jumping rope, and riding a bike.\nAerobic physical activity can range in level of intensity; for example, brisk walking is considered moderate intensity, and running or jogging is considered vigorous intensity. As intensity increases, so do heart and breathing rates to meet increased demand for oxygen in working muscles. Regular, moderate aerobic activity\u2014about thirty minutes at a time on five days per week\u2014trains the body to deliver oxygen more efficiently, which strengthens the heart and lungs and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Strengthening your heart muscle and increasing the blood volume pumped in each heartbeat boosts your ability to supply your body\u2019s cells with oxygen and nutrients and remove carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes. It also leads to a lower resting heart rate for healthy individuals. Aerobic physical activity can also help maintain a healthy weight.1\nMany aerobic activities also count as bone-strengthening activity, which promotes bone growth and strength by producing a force on the body\u2019s bones. Weight-bearing activities like running, walking, and doing jumping jacks are considered bone-strengthening, whereas activities like swimming and biking that put less force on the body\u2019s bones are not. Bone-strengthening activities are especially important during childhood and adolescence, when they promote greater bone mass and strength and improved bone structure. In older adults, participating in aerobic and bone-strengthening activities slows the decline in bone density that often occurs with aging.",

Anaerobic exercise consists of short duration, high intensity movements that rely on immediately available energy sources and require little or no oxygen during the activity. This type of training includes lifting weights, working with resistance bands, using body weight (such as for push-ups and pull-ups), and doing work such as carrying heavy loads or vigorous yard work. Building musculoskeletal fitness is not just for athletes and bodybuilders\u2014it\u2019s important for children, older adults, and everyone in between. The support that your muscles provide allows you to work, play, and live more efficiently.\nMuscle-strengthening activity often involves the use of resistance machines, resistance bands, free weights, or other tools. However, you do not need to pay for a gym membership or expensive equipment to strengthen your muscles. Homemade weights, such as plastic bottles filled with sand, can work just as well. You can also use your own body weight and do push-ups, leg squats, abdominal crunches, planks, and other exercises to build your muscles. What is important is that your training incorporates exercises that together will work all the major muscle groups of the body, including the legs, hips, chest, back, shoulders, arms, and abdomen. To improve muscle strength, do one to three sets of 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise, with enough weight that it is difficult to do another repetition at the end of a set.\nIf strength training is performed at least twice per week, it can help improve muscular fitness and bone health, as well as manage health conditions like diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, and many others.

Individuals who are physically active for 150 minutes per week lower the risk of dying early by 33 percent compared to those who are inactive.3 The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans were issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide evidence-based guidelines to Americans aged three and older about how to improve health and reduce chronic disease risk through physical activity. The full guidelines are available online at the following link: Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.4\nKey Guidelines for Adults\n\u2022 Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better than none. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits.\n\u2022 For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.\n\u2022 Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\n\u2022 Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.\nSource: 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\nImproving your overall fitness involves sticking with a physical activity program on a regular basis, so that being active becomes part of your routine. Choosing physical activity that you enjoy will increase the likelihood of sustaining the activity. If you are nervous or unsure about becoming more active, check with your doctor about the best way to get started. The good news is that moderate-intensity activities such as brisk walking are very safe for most people, and the health advantages of becoming active far outweigh the risks. Physical activity can also be social; regularly meeting a friend for a walk or joining a hiking group can make getting active more fun and social, plus help you stick to your plan. Physical activity provides a wealth of benefits\u2014physical, mental, and emotional.\n| Physical Benefits | Mental and Emotional Benefits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Longer life: A regular exercise program can reduce your risk of dying early from heart disease, certain cancers, and other leading causes of death. | Mood improvement: Aerobic activity, strength-training, and more contemplative activities such as yoga, all help break cycles of worry and distraction, effectively draining tension from the body. |\n| Healthier weight: Exercise, along with a healthy, balanced eating plan, may help you lose extra weight, maintain weight loss, or prevent excessive weight gain. | Depression relief: Exercise can produce antidepressant effects in the body. Studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of and helps people cope with the symptoms of depression. |\n| Cardiovascular disease prevention: Being active boosts HDL cholesterol and decreases unhealthy triglycerides, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. | Cognitive skills retention: Regular physical activity can help people maintain thinking, learning, and judgment as they age. |\n| Management of chronic conditions: A regular routine can help to prevent or manage a wide range of conditions and concerns, such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, depression, arthritis, and certain types of cancer. | Better sleep: A good night\u2019s sleep is essential for clear thinking, and regular exercise promotes healthy, sound sleep.",

However, in order for these nutrients to be used as fuel for the body, their energy must be transferred into the high energy molecule known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the body\u2019s immediate fuel source and can be generated either with aerobic metabolism in the presence of oxygen or anaerobic metabolism without the presence of oxygen.

    "content": "The respiratory system plays a vital role in the uptake and delivery of oxygen to muscle cells throughout the body. Oxygen is inhaled by the lungs and transferred from the lungs to the blood, where the cardiovascular system circulates the oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. The oxygen is then taken up by the muscles and can be used to generate ATP. When the body is at rest, the heart and lungs are able to supply the muscles with adequate amounts of oxygen to meet the energy needs for aerobic metabolism. However, during physical activity, your muscles need more energy and oxygen. In order to provide more oxygen to the muscle cells, your heart rate and breathing rate will increase. The amount of oxygen that is delivered to the tissues via the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during exercise depend on the duration, intensity and physical conditioning of the individual.\n* During the first few steps of exercise, your muscles are the first to respond to the change in activity level. Your lungs and heart do not react as quickly, and during those beginning steps, they can\u2019t yet increase the delivery of oxygen. In order for our bodies to get the energy that is needed in these beginning steps, the muscles rely on a small amount of ATP that is stored in resting muscles. The stored ATP is able to provide energy for only a few seconds before it is depleted. Once the stored ATP is just about used up, the body resorts to another high-energy molecule known as creatine phosphate\u00a0to convert ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to ATP. After about 10 seconds, the stored creatine phosphate in the muscle cells is also depleted as well.\n* About 15 seconds into exercise, the stored ATP and creatine phosphate are used up in the muscles. The heart and lungs have still not adapted to the increased oxygen need, so the muscles must begin to produce ATP by anaerobic metabolism (without oxygen). Anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP at a rapid pace but only uses glucose as its fuel source. The glucose is obtained from muscle glycogen. At around 30 seconds, anaerobic pathways are operating at their full capacity, but because the availability of glucose is limited, it cannot continue for a long period of time.\n* As your exercise reaches two to three minutes, your heart rate and breathing rate have increased to supply more oxygen to your muscles. Aerobic metabolism is the most efficient way of producing ATP; it produces significantly more ATP for each molecule of glucose than anaerobic metabolism. Although the primary source of ATP in aerobic metabolism is carbohydrates, fatty acids and protein can also be used as fuel to generate ATP.\nFigure 10.2. Energy systems used to fuel exercise change with duration of exercise. The ATP-creatine phosphate system is used up within seconds. The short-term and long-term systems kick in and provide energy for exercise as the duration of the workout goes on.\nThe fuel sources for anaerobic and aerobic metabolism will change depending on the amount of nutrients available and the type of metabolism.\n* Glucose may come from blood glucose (which is from dietary carbohydrates, liver glycogen, and glucose synthesis) or muscle glycogen. Glucose is the primary energy source for both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism.\n* Fatty acids are stored as triglycerides in muscles, but about 90 percent of stored energy is found in adipose tissue. As low- to moderate-intensity exercise continues using aerobic metabolism, fatty acids become the predominant fuel source for exercising muscles.\n* Although protein is not considered a major energy source, small amounts of amino acids are used while resting or doing an activity. The amount of amino acids used for energy metabolism increases if the total energy intake from your diet does not meet your nutrient needs or if you are involved in long endurance exercise.",

    "content": "Exercise intensity determines the contribution of different fuel sources used for ATP production. Both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism combine during exercise to ensure that the muscles are equipped with enough ATP to carry out the demands placed on them. The contribution from each type of metabolism depends on the intensity of an activity. During low-intensity activities, aerobic metabolism is used to supply enough ATP to muscles. However, during high-intensity activities, more ATP is needed, so the muscles must rely on both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism to meet the body\u2019s demands.\n| Activity Intensity | Activity Duration | Preferred Fuel | Oxygen Needed? | Activity Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Very high | 30 sec \u2013 3 min | Glucose | No \u2013 anaerobic | Sprinting |\n| High | 3 min \u2013 20 min | Glucose | Yes \u2013 aerobic | Jogging |\n| Low to moderate | >20 min | Fat | Yes \u2013 aerobic | Walking |\nTable 10.2. Summary of fuels used for activities of different intensities and durations.\nDuring low-intensity activities, the body will use aerobic metabolism over anaerobic metabolism, because it is more efficient and produces larger amounts of ATP. Fatty acids are the primary energy source during low-intensity activity. With fat reserves in the body being almost unlimited, low-intensity activities are able to continue for a long time. Along with fatty acids, a small amount of glucose is used as well. Glucose differs from fatty acids, because glycogen storages can be depleted. As glycogen stores are depleted, the glucose supply becomes depleted, and fatigue will eventually set in.\nFigure 10.4. The effect of exercise intensity on fuel sources. Anaerobic exercise utilizes only glucose for fuel. As activities become more aerobic, the body can utilize fatty acids and, to a small extent, amino acids, for energy production.\nOne important clarification about exercise intensity and fuel sources is the concept of the fat-burning zone. Many people think that in order to lose body fat, they should exercise at a lower intensity so that fat is the primary fuel source. The fat-burning zone is typically referred to as a low-intensity aerobic activity that keeps your heart rate between 60 and 69 percent of maximum heart rate. The cardio zone, on the other hand, is a high-intensity aerobic activity that keeps the heart rate between about 70 and 85 percent of maximum heart rate. So which zone do you burn the most fat in? Technically, your body burns a higher percentage of calories from fat during a low-intensity aerobic activity. When you begin a low-intensity activity, about 50% of the calories burned come from fat, whereas in the cardio zone only 40% come from fat. However, this isn\u2019t the whole story. High-intensity activity burns more total calories per minute. At this higher rate of energy expenditure, you can burn just as much or more total fat and more total calories as during a lower intensity activity. If weight loss is one of your goals, high-intensity activities will burn more total calories, helping to shift to negative energy balance, and will promote a greater level of fitness. However, the best exercise program is one that is enjoyable, sustainable, and safe for you; if you\u2019re just starting out, it\u2019s wise to begin with low- to moderate-intensity activities and work your way up from there.\nFigure 10.5. The fat-burning zone. While a greater percentage of calories burned in lower intensity exercise come from fat, the overall total calorie burn is greater in higher intensity exercise.",

Energy intake is the foundation of an athlete\u2019s diet, because it supports optimal body functions, affects intake of macronutrients and micronutrients, and assists in maintaining body composition. Energy needs for athletes increase depending on their energy expenditure. The amount of energy expended during physical activity is contingent on the intensity, duration, and frequency of the exercise. Competitive athletes may need 3,000 to over 5,000 calories daily compared to a typical inactive individual who needs about 2,000 calories per day. Energy needs are also affected by an individual\u2019s sex, age, and weight. Weight-bearing exercises, such as running, burn more calories per hour than non-weight-bearing exercises, such as swimming, since weight-bearing exercises require your body to move against gravity. Additionally, men typically burn more calories than women for the same activity, because men have more muscle mass which requires more energy to support and move around.",

    "content": "Although protein accounts for only about 5% of energy expended, dietary protein is necessary to support metabolic reactions that generate ATP, which rely heavily on proteins such as enzymes and transport proteins. Additional protein also helps muscles with maintenance, growth, and repair. For these reasons, athletes have higher protein needs than the general population. It is recommended that athletes consume 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg/day of protein in order to support these functions. Higher intakes may also be needed for short periods of intense training or when reducing energy intake.1\nIt is important to consume adequate amounts of protein and to understand that the quality of the protein consumed affects the amount needed. Complete protein foods such as meats, dairy, and eggs contain all of the essential amino acids in relative amounts that most efficiently meet the body\u2019s needs for growth, maintenance, and repair of muscles. Vegetarian diets contain mostly incomplete protein sources, which have lower digestibility and amino acid patterns that do not match human needs as closely as most animal proteins. To compensate for this, vegetarian athletes need to consume more dietary protein than non-vegetarians and should target the upper end of the recommended protein intake.\nIn addition to the amount and quality of proteins consumed, timing of protein intake has been shown to impact muscle protein synthesis. Studies show that the synthesis of muscle protein is optimized with high quality protein consumption after exercise, ideally 15 to 25 grams of protein in the early recovery phase after a workout (0-2 hours after exercise). A similar amount of protein should be consumed every 3-5 hours, spread out across the day over multiple meals within the 24 hours post-workout, so that amino acids are always available for optimal protein synthesis.2 One recommended strategy is to aim for 0.4 g/kg/meal across four meals in order to reach 1.6 g/kg/day for muscle synthesis.3\nAlthough athletic training increases protein needs, athletes can meet their protein requirement through high quality food sources, and most do not need to consume protein supplements. Here are some examples of snacks or small meals that contain at least 15 to 25 grams of protein4:\n* \u00bd cup of granola plus \u00bc cup almonds (16 grams protein)\n* 7 oz. Greek yogurt (20 grams protein)\n* Peanut butter sandwich (20 grams protein)\n* 2 scrambled eggs and 1 cup of milk (20 grams protein)\n* 3 oz. canned tuna (\u00bd can) with \u00bd cup crackers (22 grams protein)\n* Turkey and cheese sandwich (32 grams protein)\nThese whole food options have the benefit of coming packaged with other nutrients, including carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores, fiber, and micronutrients, and are often less costly than most protein supplements. Like all dietary supplements, protein shakes and other supplements are not well-regulated; some contain unnecessary additives such as sweeteners and herbs, and some have been found to contain unsafe levels of heavy metals like arsenic and mercury. Protein supplements do have the benefit of being convenient and shelf-stable. If you choose to use a protein supplement, look for one certified by a third-party testing organization and with a simple ingredient list.5",

    "content": "During exercise, being appropriately hydrated contributes to performance. Water is needed to cool the body, transport oxygen and nutrients, and remove waste products from the muscles. Water needs are increased during exercise due to the extra water losses through evaporation and sweat. Dehydration can occur when there are inadequate water levels in the body and can be very hazardous to the health of an individual. As the severity of dehydration increases, the exercise performance of an individual will begin to decline (see Figure 10.6). It is important to continue to consume water before, during, and after exercise to avoid dehydration as much as possible.\nFigure 10.6. The effect of dehydration on exercise performance.\nDuring exercise, thirst is not a reliable short-term indicator of the body\u2019s water needs, as it typically is not enough to replace the water lost. Even with constant replenishing of water throughout a workout, it may not be possible to drink enough water to compensate for the losses. Dehydration\u00a0occurs when water loss is so significant that total blood volume decreases, which leads to a reduction in oxygen and nutrients transported to the muscle cells. A decreased blood volume also reduces blood flow to the skin and the production of sweat, which can increase body temperature. As a result, the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke, increases. The external temperature during exercise can also play a role in the risk of heat-related illnesses. As the external temperature increases, it becomes more difficult for the body to dissipate heat. As humidity also increases, the body is unable to cool itself through evaporation.",

During most types of exercise, the amount of sodium lost is very small, and drinking water after a workout will replenish the sodium in the body. However, during long endurance exercises, such as a marathon or triathlon, sodium losses are larger and must be replenished. If water is replenished without sodium, the sodium already in the body will become diluted. These low levels of sodium in the blood will cause a condition known as hyponatremia. When sodium levels in the blood are decreased, water moves into cells through osmosis, which causes swelling. Accumulation of fluid in the lungs and the brain can cause serious, life-threatening conditions such as seizure, coma, and death (see Unit 9).\nIn order to avoid hyponatremia, athletes should increase their consumption of sodium in the days leading up to an event and consume sodium-containing sports drinks during their race or event. A well-concocted sports drink contains sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood-glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces some of that lost in sweat.

Therefore, it\u2019s recommended to establish healthy eating and exercise habits and work towards a healthy weight before pregnancy.1 Nutrition before conception is also important for fathers; studies have shown that sperm quality is better in fathers who have a healthy body weight, consume adequate amounts of folate and omega-3 fatty acids, and follow a healthy dietary pattern, such as a Mediterranean diet emphasizing seafood, poultry, whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables.2\nPregnancy begins when the sperm fertilizes the egg, and the single cell formed from this union begins to divide and differentiate. During the first few weeks of development, the cells of the uterine lining provide nutrients to the developing embryo. Between the 4th and 12th weeks, the developing placenta gradually takes over the role of feeding the embryo, which is called a fetus beginning in the 9th week of pregnancy. The placenta\u00a0forms from tissues deriving from both the fetus and the mother, and this new organ becomes the interface between the two. The placenta provides nutrition and respiration, handles waste from the fetus, and produces hormones important to maintaining the pregnancy.\u00a0The blood of the fetus and mother do not mix in the placenta, but they come close enough that nutrients (including glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals) and oxygen can pass from the mother\u2019s blood to the fetus, and carbon dioxide and waste products can be passed from the fetus to the mother.3\nFigure 11.1. Cross-section of the placenta. In the placenta, the maternal and fetal bloodstreams do not mix, but nutrients, gasses, and waste products can diffuse between them. \u00a0\nThe first trimester is a key period for the formation of embryonic and fetal organs. During the second and third trimesters, the fetus continues to grow and develop, with final development of organs such as the brain, lungs, and liver continuing in the last few weeks of pregnancy. Infants born before 37 weeks of pregnancy are considered preterm, and because they have not completed fetal development, are at increased risk for a range of health problems. Advances in neonatal care have greatly improved outcomes for these babies born too soon, but in most cases, the best scenario is for the fetus to have the full term of pregnancy to develop in the protective environment of the uterus, receiving nutrients through the placenta.4",

    "content": "During the first trimester, energy requirements are generally not increased, so women should consume about the same number of calories as they did before pregnancy. As fetal growth ramps up, energy requirements increase by about 340 calories per day in the second trimester and 450 calories per day in the third trimester. This is just an average; individual energy requirements vary depending on factors such as activity level and body weight before pregnancy.6-7\nWeight gain is a normal part of pregnancy. The growth of the fetus accounts for about 6 to 8 pounds of weight gain by the end of the pregnancy. Much of the rest comes from the development and expansion of tissues and fluids to support the pregnancy, including the placenta, uterus, breasts, amniotic fluid, blood, and maternal body fluids. In addition, women starting pregnancy at a normal weight should gain about 8 to 10 pounds of body fat and protein during pregnancy, in part to prepare for lactation.3\nFigure 11.2. Components of weight gain in healthy pregnant women with normal BMI before pregnancy. Weight gain comes not just from the baby, but from many different body systems changing to support the pregnancy.\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends different amounts of weight gain in pregnancy depending on pre-pregnancy BMI. Women who were underweight before pregnancy need to gain more, and those who were overweight or obese before pregnancy need to gain less. Gaining too little weight in pregnancy can compromise fetal growth, leading to the baby being born too small, which can cause increased risk of illness, difficulty feeding, and developmental delays. Gaining too much weight in pregnancy can cause the baby to be too big at birth, leading to birth complications and increasing the risk of needing a cesarean birth. It can also make it more difficult to lose weight after pregnancy.8\n| Prepregnancy Weight Category | Body Mass Index (BMI) | Recommended Range of Total Weight Gain (lb) | Recommended Rates of Weight Gain in the 2nd and 3rd Trimesters (lb/wk) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Underweight | Less than 18.8 | 28-40 | 1 (1-1.3) |\n| Normal weight | 18.5-24.9 | 25-35 | 1 (0.8-1) |\n| Overweight | 25-29.9 | 15-25 | 0.6 (0.5-0.7) |\n| Obese | 30 and greater | 11-20 | 0.5 (0.4-0.6) |\nTable 11.1. Recommended weight gain during pregnancy depends on prepregnancy BMI.7  \nExercising during pregnancy can promote the health of both the mother and the baby. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, regular exercise in pregnancy can reduce back pain, ease constipation, promote healthy weight gain, improve overall fitness, and help with weight loss after the baby is born. It may also decrease the risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery. ACOG recommends that pregnant women get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. Most forms of exercise are safe in pregnancy; women should consult their healthcare provider for individualized advice about exercising while pregnant.9",

    "content": "The Acceptable Macronutrient Distributions Ranges (AMDR) for macronutrients are the same for all healthy adults, pregnant or not, with about 45 to 65 percent of calories coming from carbohydrates, 20 to 35 percent from fats, and 10 to 35 percent from protein. As energy intake increases, a pregnant woman needs more of each of these macronutrients. \nThe RDA for carbohydrates increases from 130 grams per day for non-pregnant adults to 175 grams per day for pregnant women. This level of carbohydrate intake provides energy for fetal development and ensures adequate glucose for both the mother\u2019s and the fetus\u2019s brain. The recommended fiber intake in pregnancy, expressed as an AI, is the same as for all adults: 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories consumed. As caloric intake increases during pregnancy, so should fiber intake, emphasizing the importance of choosing whole food sources of carbohydrates. \nAdditional protein is also needed during pregnancy. Protein builds muscle and other tissues, enzymes, antibodies, and hormones in both the mother and the fetus, as well as supporting increased blood volume and the production of amniotic fluid. The RDA for protein during pregnancy is 1.1 grams per kg body weight per day, coming to about 71 grams per day for an average woman\u2014roughly 25 grams more than needed before pregnancy.1\nThere is not a specific RDA for fat during pregnancy. Fats should continue to make up 25 to 35 percent of daily caloric intake, providing energy and essential fatty acids (linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid), as well as helping with fat-soluble vitamin absorption. The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA become more important during pregnancy and lactation, because they are essential for brain and eye development of the fetus and infant. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that pregnant women consume 8 to 12 ounces of seafood each week, in part to provide omega-3 fatty acids. Fish with high levels of mercury should be avoided; these include king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish, and bigeye tuna.11-12\nFigure 11.3.

Aim for 8 to 12 ounces of low-mercury seafood each week.\n* Choose fiber-rich sources of carbohydrates, including whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes and squash.\n* Drink mainly water, decaf coffee, or tea.

These requirements can be met from food sources, but obstetricians also generally recommend that women take a prenatal supplement while trying to conceive and during pregnancy. This ensures that nutrient requirements are met, while also providing a little peace of mind if pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting limit dietary variety and quality.1\nThe following table compares the recommended intake levels of some vitamins and minerals to the levels needed in pregnancy.\n| Nutrient | RDA/AI,  Nonpregnant  Adult Women | RDA/AI, Pregnant Adult | Importance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Vitamin A | 700 mcg | 770 mcg | Forms healthy skin and eyesight; helps with bone growth |\n| Vitamin B6 | 1.3 mg | 1.9 mg | Helps form red blood cells; helps the body metabolize macronutrients |\n| Vitamin B12 | 2.4 mcg | 2.6 mcg | Maintains nervous system; helps form red blood cells |\n| Vitamin C | 75 mg | 85 mg | Promotes healthy gums, teeth, and bones |\n| Vitamin D | 600 IU | 600 IU | Builds fetal bones and teeth; promotes healthy eyesight and skin |\n| Folate | 400 mcg | 600 mcg | Helps prevent neural tube defects; supports growth and development of fetus and placenta |\n| Calcium | 1,000 mg | 1,000 mg | Builds strong bones and teeth |\n| Iron | 18 mg | 27 mg | Helps red blood cells deliver oxygen to fetus |\n| Iodine | 150 mcg | 220 mg | Essential for healthy brain development |\n| Choline | 425 mg | 450 mg | Important for development of fetal brain and spinal cord |\n|  |  |  |  |\nTable 11.2. Recommended Micronutrient intakes during pregnancy. Sources: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements.\nAmong the micronutrients, folate, iron, and iodine deserve a special mention. Folate is essential for the growth and specialization of cells of the central nervous system (see Unit 9). Mothers who are folate-deficient during pregnancy have a higher risk of having a baby with a neural tube birth defect such as spina bifida. Folic acid fortification of grains in the U.S. has helped to raise folate intake in the general population and has reduced the incidence of neural tube defects. However, dietary intake is often not adequate to meet the requirement of 600 mcg folate per day in pregnancy, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women take an additional 400 mcg of folic acid each day, an amount usually included in prenatal supplements.13The neural tube closes by day 28 of pregnancy, before a woman may realize she is pregnant, so it\u2019s important to consume adequate folate while trying to conceive. Because about 45 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned, a folic acid supplement is a good idea for anyone who may become pregnant.14\nIron intake is important because of the increase in blood volume during pregnancy. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport in blood, so adequate iron intake supports oxygen delivery to both maternal and fetal tissues (see Unit 9). Good dietary sources of iron include meat, poultry, seafood, nuts, legumes, and fortified or whole grain cereals. Iron should also be included in a prenatal supplement or taken separately.\nIodine is essential for fetal brain development, but recent data suggests that many pregnant women in the U.S. do not consume enough iodine to meet their increased requirement.15Much of the iodine in the typical American diet comes from dairy products and iodized salt. However, iodine intake in the U.S. has declined in recent decades as more people watch their intake of table salt and/or switch to kosher or sea salt, which aren\u2019t iodized. In addition, processed foods are generally made with non-iodized salt, and the intake of processed foods has increased. Meanwhile, the popularity of dairy products has declined. Most people in the U.S.",

    "content": "still consume enough iodine to meet their requirement, but pregnant women may be at risk for iodine deficiency because of their increased need for this mineral. Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and major neurodevelopmental deficits and growth retardation in the fetus.16Unfortunately, many prenatal vitamins do not contain iodine, so it\u2019s worth checking the label to ensure that iodine is included.17\nThe micronutrients involved with building the skeleton\u2014vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium\u2014are crucial during pregnancy to support fetal bone development. Although the levels are the same as those for nonpregnant women, many women do not typically consume adequate amounts and should make an extra effort to meet those needs.\nAs always, it\u2019s important to read supplement labels carefully, with the aim of choosing a prenatal supplement that contains close to the RDA or AI for micronutrients and avoiding those that exceed the UL, unless under the specific direction of a healthcare provider. In particular, both vitamin A and zinc consumed in excessive amounts can cause birth defects. Beta-carotene is typically used as the vitamin A source in prenatal supplements, because unlike vitamin A, it doesn\u2019t cause birth defects (see Unit 8)..",

    "content": "It\u2019s not just nutrients that can cross the placenta. Other substances such as alcohol, nicotine, cannabinoids (from cannabis), and both prescription and recreational drugs can also pass from mother to fetus. Exposure to these substances can have lasting and detrimental effects on the health of the fetus. For this reason, pregnant women are advised to avoid using alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and recreational drugs during pregnancy. Medical providers can help pregnant women quit using these substances and advise them on the safety of specific medications needed during pregnancy.1\nSome substances are so detrimental that a woman should avoid them even if she suspects that she might be pregnant. For example, consumption of alcoholic beverages results in a range of abnormalities that fall under the umbrella of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. They include learning and attention deficits, heart defects, and abnormal facial features (Figure 11.5). \u00a0Alcohol enters the fetus\u2019s bloodstream via the umbilical cord and can slow fetal growth, damage the brain, or even result in miscarriage. The effects of alcohol are most severe in the first trimester, when the organs are developing. There is no known safe amount of alcohol in pregnancy. \nFigure 11.5. Craniofacial features associated with fetal alcohol syndrome.\nCaffeine use should be limited to less than 200 milligrams per day, or the equivalent of about two cups of coffee. Consumption of greater amounts is linked to miscarriage and preterm birth. Keep in mind that caffeine is also found in other sources such as chocolate, energy drinks, soda, tea, and some over-the-counter pain and headache medications.1\nIt\u2019s also important to pay special attention to avoiding foodborne illness during pregnancy, as it can cause major health problems for both the mother and the developing fetus. For example, the foodborne illness caused by the bacteria Listeria\u00a0monocytogenes, called listeriosis, \u00a0can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and fetal or newborn meningitis. According to the CDC, pregnant women are ten times more likely\u00a0to become ill with this disease than nonpregnant adults, likely because they have a dampened immune response.19\u00a0Other common foodborne illnesses, such as those caused by Salmonella\u00a0and\u00a0E. coli, can also be very serious in pregnant women.\nFoods more likely to be contaminated with foodborne pathogens should be avoided by pregnant women to decrease their chances of infection. These\u00a0include the following:20\n* Unpasteurized dairy products such as soft cheeses\n* Raw or smoked seafood\n* Hot dogs and deli meats (or heat to 165\u00b0 before eating)\n* Pat\u00e9 and other meat spreads\n* Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, and eggs\n* Raw sprouts\n* Raw dough\n* Unpasteurized juice and cider\nFollowing standard food safety practices can also go a long way towards preventing foodborne illness, during pregnancy or anytime. The CDC offers this summary of food safety tips:\n* COOK. Use a food thermometer to ensure that foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature: 145\u00b0F for whole beef, pork, lamb, and veal (allowing the meat to rest for 3 minutes before carving or consuming), 160\u00b0F for ground meats, and 165\u00b0F for all poultry, including ground chicken and turkey.\n* CLEAN.\u00a0Wash your hands after touching raw meat, poultry, and seafood. Also wash your work surfaces, cutting boards, utensils, and grill before and after cooking.\n* CHILL.\u00a0Keep your refrigerator below 40\u00b0F and refrigerate foods within 2 hours of cooking (1 hour during the summer heat).\n* SEPARATE.\u00a0Germs from raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs can spread to produce and ready-to-eat foods unless you keep them separate. Use different cutting boards to prepare raw meats and any food that will be eaten without cooking.",

    "content": "Especially during the first trimester, it\u2019s very common for women to feel nauseous, often leading to vomiting, and to be very sensitive to smells. This so-called \u201cmorning sickness\u201d is misnamed, because it can make women feel awful any time of day\u2014morning, noon, and night. Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy affects as many as four out of five pregnancies. Symptoms can range from mild nausea to a much more severe illness called hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes relentless vomiting and affects between 0.3 and 3 percent of all pregnancies. Most women find that their nausea and vomiting subsides by the end of the first trimester, but in rare and unfortunate cases, it can continue until the baby is born.21\nDietary changes can help alleviate nausea and vomiting. Here are some suggestions:22\n* Choose foods that are low in fat and easily digestible,\u00a0such as those in the BRATT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, and tea). The goal is simply to find foods that can be tolerated. It is reassuring to remember that pregnancy does not require extra calories during the first trimester, and a prenatal supplement can help meet micronutrient needs.\n* An empty stomach can worsen feelings of nausea, so try eating a few crackers or dry toast before getting out of bed in the morning to avoid moving around with an empty stomach. It may also help to eat five or six small meals per day and to eat small snacks such as crackers, fruits, and nuts throughout the day.\n* Many pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting find meat unappetizing. Try other sources of protein\u00a0such as dairy foods (e.g., milk, yogurt, ice cream), nuts and seeds (as well as nut butters), and protein powders and shakes.\n* Ginger can help settle your stomach; it\u2019s available in capsule, candy, and tea form. Ginger ale, if made with real ginger, might also be helpful.\nIf nausea and vomiting remain unmanageable after making these dietary changes, medications may be necessary. Hyperemesis gravidarum, though rare, can be very serious. Constant vomiting can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Hospitalization may be required so that women can receive fluids and electrolytes through an intravenous line, and sometimes a feeding tube is necessary. Getting help for this condition can be a frustrating process of trial-and-error, and unfortunately, there are still many unknowns about its causes and effective treatment options.23\nAs pregnancy progresses, another common complaint is heartburn, caused by gastroesophageal reflux.\u00a0This is caused by the upward, constrictive pressure of the growing uterus on the stomach, as well as decreased peristalsis in the GI tract. (See Unit 3 for management strategies.)\u00a0\nAbout 6 percent of pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by gestational diabetes\u00a0(see Unit 4).24This is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy in women who didn\u2019t previously have diabetes. Gestational diabetes is managed by monitoring blood glucose levels, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Sometimes, insulin injections are needed. If blood glucose levels aren\u2019t well controlled in the mother, the fetus will also have high blood glucose levels. This can cause the baby to grow too big, leading to a greater chance of birth complications and increased likelihood of needing a cesarean birth.25",

    "content": "The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as many other health organizations, recommend that infants be exclusively breastfed (only receiving breast milk, with no formula or other foods) for about the first 6 months of life. Breast milk is considered the optimal source of nutrition for infants, but it also contains many other bioactive molecules, including immunoglobulins (or antibodies), hormones, enzymes, growth factors, and protective proteins.3 In addition, breast milk contains special carbohydrates, called human milk oligosaccharides, that are indigestible to infants (they lack the enzymes to break them down) but help to establish a healthy gut microbiome by serving as a food source for friendly bacteria and binding up harmful bacteria.4\nBreastfeeding is beneficial to babies in many ways; it reduces a baby\u2019s risk of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and ear infections, and it may also protect babies from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), eczema, and asthma. It is also associated with a small increase in IQ and a reduced risk of obesity later in childhood. In addition, breastfeeding benefits the health of mothers; it\u2019s associated with a reduced risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and breast and ovarian cancer.3 However, it\u2019s important to note that most of the data on benefits of breastfeeding come from observational studies, and these studies have many confounding factors. Women who breastfeed tend to have higher incomes, be more educated, be older in age, and are more likely to be white compared with those who don\u2019t breastfeed. This means breastfed babies are often born with more advantages beyond how they are fed, so it can be difficult to separate correlation from causation in studies of infant feeding outcomes.5\nDespite the challenges in breastfeeding research, breastfeeding has many well-established benefits, and most mothers intend to breastfeed. In 2017, 84% of babies born in the U.S. were breastfed at birth, but just 58% were still breastfeeding at 6 months of age, and 26% were exclusively breastfed through 6 months.6 These statistics represent the many challenges women face with breastfeeding. Although breastfeeding is natural, it doesn\u2019t always come naturally or easily. Breastfeeding challenges can often be addressed with the help of an experienced professional such as a lactation consultant, but this support is not easy for all women to access. Women may also find it hard to establish and continue breastfeeding if they have to return to work just a few weeks or months postpartum, a scenario common in the U.S., the only developed country that has no national policy for paid parental leave.7,8\nThere are also a few circumstances in which babies should not or can not be breastfed. In the U.S., it\u2019s recommended that women infected with HIV do not breastfeed, because the virus can pass to infants in milk. Infants born with rare metabolic disorders may not be able to metabolize breast milk and need to receive special formulas. There are also some medications which, if taken by the mother, are not safe for breastfeeding infants. In these cases, mothers may be advised to formula-feed.3\nMany women find breastfeeding enjoyable and a wonderful way to bond with their baby. For others, breastfeeding can be a struggle for one or more of the reasons discussed above, and that struggle can overshadow a mother\u2019s relationship with her baby. For all of these reasons, the choice to breastfeed or formula-feed, or to feed some of both, is complex and individual. Parents should be supported whatever their decision, and they can be confident that infant formula is a safe, nutritionally-adequate option.",

    "content": "The first milk, called colostrum, is produced immediately after birth and continues for the first two to five days after the arrival of the baby. Colostrum is yellowish in color, thicker than mature breast milk, and produced in small quantities. It is low in fat and easily digestible, yet rich in protein, fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals. Colostrum is also a concentrated source of immunoglobulins that pass from the mother to the baby and provide immune protection to the newborn. The stomach capacity of newborns is small, so they only consume a teaspoon or two of colostrum per feeding in the first few days of life, but they need to feed often. Frequent, on-demand feeding (whenever the baby is hungry, not on a schedule) helps to promote full milk production.5\nAfter a couple of days, colostrum is replaced by transitional milk, which is produced in much greater volume and lasts through 7 to 14 days postpartum. Compared with colostrum, transitional milk has more fat and lactose, and less protein and immunoglobulins, and it is also more calorie-dense. Finally, women begin to produce mature milk and will continue to make this type of milk through the end of lactation. Mature milk contains about 87% water, 4% fat, 1% protein, and 7% lactose. Together, these meet infants\u2019 macronutrient and caloric requirements.9\nHowever, there is variability even within mature milk. In a given feeding, the milk secreted at the beginning of the feeding (called foremilk) is thinner and higher in lactose than the milk at the end of the feeding (called hindmilk). The higher levels of fat in the hindmilk helps to ensure the baby\u2019s energy needs are met.9 Milk can also vary from day to night; nighttime milk is higher in fat and the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin.10 As breastfeeding continues beyond 6 or 7 months, the levels of some vitamins and minerals begin to decline. This is around the time that babies begin to eat some solid foods, so foods can help to fill in nutritional gaps, while breast milk continues to be an important source of nutrients.5\nBreast milk provides enough of all of the micronutrients that young infants need with two main exceptions: vitamin K and vitamin D. For this reason, newborns should receive a vitamin K shot soon after birth; otherwise, vitamin K deficiency can lead to serious bleeding disorders such as hemorrhage (see Unit 9). The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that breastfed newborns be given a vitamin D supplement beginning in the first few days of life and continuing until they are weaned to formula or cow\u2019s milk, both of which are fortified with adequate vitamin D. (Cow\u2019s milk can be given beginning at 12 months of age.)11\nBreast milk is also low in iron, although what little is there is absorbed very efficiently. Newborns are born with a certain amount of iron absorbed from their mothers during pregnancy, and they utilize this stored iron\u2014in addition to that provided in breast milk\u2014to meet their iron requirement in early infancy. However, stored iron is depleted by around 4 months of age, so the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that exclusively breastfed infants begin taking an iron supplement at this age and continuing until they are eating substantial amounts of iron-rich solid foods, such as meat or iron-fortified cereals. Iron deficiency remains a significant problem, with 11% of 1-year-olds in the U.S. estimated to be iron-deficient.11 Iron is essential for brain development, and iron deficiency may cause lasting developmental deficits.12",

    "content": "Breastfeeding mothers have nutrient requirements similar to women in the third trimester of pregnancy. After all, they\u2019re continuing to provide nutrients for their babies through their milk, and milk production requires energy, macronutrients, micronutrients, and water. Breastfeeding women have a remarkable ability to make enough milk to meet their babies\u2019 nutrient needs even without an optimal diet, but eating well supports maternal health and energy levels during this demanding time.\nBreastfeeding increases energy requirements by about 450 to 500 calories per day, part of which can be supplied by using adipose stored in pregnancy and part of which should be supplied from greater caloric intake. In general, breastfeeding mothers can eat a wide variety of foods, and they don\u2019t usually need to avoid or restrict any specific foods. However, as in pregnancy, they should continue to avoid high-mercury fish. Consuming low-mercury fish 2 to 3 times per week provides the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, which pass into breast milk and support brain and eye development for the breastfeeding infant.13 There is no need to avoid common food allergens, such as peanut or dairy; avoiding these foods while breastfeeding has not been shown to reduce babies\u2019 chances of developing food allergies.14 Sometimes women find that certain foods, such as garlic or spicy foods, are associated with fussiness or gas in their infants, and they may experiment with avoiding those foods. However, most infants don\u2019t have a problem tolerating these foods. In fact, flavors from the mother\u2019s diet pass into breast milk, so researchers hypothesize that when mothers eat a wide variety of foods and flavors while breastfeeding, their children grow up to be more adventurous eaters.15\nIn addition to consuming a nutrient-dense diet, obstetricians sometimes recommend that breastfeeding mothers continue taking a prenatal supplement to ensure that their micronutrient needs are met. Breastfeeding mothers should also be sure to drink plenty of fluids to support milk production.13\nSimilar to pregnancy, substances consumed by the breastfeeding mother can pass to the infant in her milk. However, how much passes into the milk depends on the type of substance and the timing of consumption relative to breastfeeding. For example, it\u2019s considered safe for a breastfeeding mother to have an alcoholic drink so long as she waits at least two hours before breastfeeding, because by that point, most of the alcohol will have cleared her bloodstream and will not pass into her milk. Caffeine lasts longer in the blood but is considered safe in moderation, with a limit of about 300 milligrams per day.13 Cannabinoids, the chemicals found in cannabis, are fat-soluble and remain in a mother\u2019s bloodstream and body tissues for much longer. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in cannabis, has been detected in breast milk as much as 6 weeks after a mother used cannabis.16 Although it\u2019s not clear how these chemicals affect babies when consumed in breast milk, medical organizations agree it\u2019s best to avoid using cannabis while breastfeeding.\nThe National Institutes of Health\u2019s LactMed database is a great resource for information about the safety of drugs, medications, and supplements during breastfeeding.",

    "content": "To a certain extent, the nutrient composition of infant formula is modeled after that of human milk, and although it by no means duplicates breast milk, it is a safe and effective substitute. Formula is made from ingredients such as cow\u2019s milk, soy, vegetable oils,\nand corn syrup. These may be combined in ways to mimic the overall macronutrient composition of breast milk, but the content of individual amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars can vary somewhat. In addition, some of these nutrients are less digestible, so to compensate, formulas tend to have higher levels of some nutrients, such as protein, compared with breast milk. Formula contains more of some micronutrients, such as iron, vitamin D, and vitamin K, so deficiencies of these vitamins and minerals are more common in breastfed infants if they don\u2019t receive appropriate supplementation or solid foods when the time comes.17\nInfant formula also does not contain most of the bioactive molecules found in breast milk, although formula companies are beginning to add versions of some of these molecules. For example, many formulas now include some type of indigestible sugar molecule intended to act as a prebiotic to feed healthy gut bacteria, similar to human milk oligosaccharides. At this point, however, the evidence that such ingredients are beneficial to infants is not very convincing. However, novel ingredients like these are often used as marketing tools, with labels touting vague structure-function claims such as \u201cbrain-boosting\u201d and \u201cimmune-supporting.\u201d Consumers should know that there is often little evidence that \u201cdesigner ingredients\u201d in infant formula make them healthier for babies. All infant formulas are required by law to be safe and meet the nutrient requirements of infants, and in most cases, basic store brand formulas cost less and are just as good as other products on the shelf. It may be true that infant formula can\u2019t replicate the complexity of breast milk, but it has a very strong track record of safety, and infants can grow and thrive with formula-feeding.17",

    "content": "The World Health Organization recommends that babies begin eating some solid foods at 6 months while continuing to breastfeed. Other health organizations offer more flexible advice, recommending that solid foods be introduced sometime between 4 and 6 months, depending on the baby\u2019s development, interest in eating solids, and family preferences. Regardless, most babies aren\u2019t ready to eat solid foods before 4 months, and starting too soon may increase the risk of obesity. Yet it\u2019s also important not to start solids too late, as beyond 6 months, breast milk alone can\u2019t support a baby\u2019s nutrient requirements.1\nHowever, as babies begin to eat solids, breast milk or formula continue to be the nutritional foundation of the diet. This period is also called complementary feeding, because solid foods are meant to complement the nutrients provided by breast milk or formula. Between 6 and 12 months, babies gradually eat more solid foods and less milk so that by 12 months, formula is no longer needed. Breastfeeding mothers may choose to wean at 12 months or continue breastfeeding as long as she and the baby like.\nBabies should be developmentally ready to eat solids before trying their first foods. A baby ready for solids should be able to do the following:1\n* Sit up without support (e.g., in a high chair or lap)\n* Open mouth for a spoonful of food and swallow it without gagging or pushing it back out\n* Reach for and grasp food or toys and bring them to his or her mouth\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends beginning with iron-rich foods such as pureed meat or iron-fortified cereal (e.g., rice cereal, oatmeal), as iron is usually the most limiting nutrient at this age, particularly for exclusively breastfed babies. Once these foods are introduced, others can gradually be added to the diet, introducing one at a time to keep an eye out for allergic reactions. Work up to a variety of foods from all of the food groups, as babies are willing to try just about anything at this stage, and this is an opportunity for them to learn about different flavors. You can also gradually increase texture, from pureed to mashed food, then lumpy foods to soft finger foods. By 12 months, most babies can eat most of the foods at the family table, with some modifications to avoid choking hazards.1,2\nWhen choosing good complementary foods, there are three main goals: (1) to meet nutrient requirements; (2) to introduce potentially allergenic foods; and (3) to support your baby in learning to eat many different flavors and textures. Parents should be sure to include the following:1,2\n* Good sources of iron and zinc, as both minerals can be limiting for breastfed infants. Good sources include meat, poultry, fish, and iron-fortified cereal. Beans, whole grains, and green vegetables add smaller amounts of iron.\n* Adequate fat to support babies\u2019 rapid growth and brain development. Good sources include whole fat yogurt, avocado, nut butters, and olive oil for cooking vegetables. Fish is also a great food for babies, because it provides both iron and fat, and it\u2019s a good source of omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, which support brain development.\n* A variety of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, so that your baby learns to like many different tastes and textures. It may take babies and toddlers 8 to 10 exposures of a new food before they learn to like it, so don\u2019t be discouraged if your baby doesn\u2019t like some foods right away.\nThere is no need to avoid giving your baby common food allergens, such as peanut, egg, dairy, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, or tree nuts. In fact, studies indicate that introducing at least some of these foods during the first year can prevent food allergies from developing. The evidence is strongest for peanut allergy.",

These include the following:1\n* Cow\u2019s milk can\u2019t match the nutrition provided by breast milk or formula and can cause intestinal bleeding in infants. However, dairy products such as yogurt and cheese are good choices for babies who have started solids. Babies can eat other dairy products, like yogurt and cheese, and cow\u2019s milk can be added to the diet at 12 months.\n* Plant-based beverages such as soy and rice milk aren\u2019t formulated for infants, lack key nutrients, and often have added sugar.\n* Juice and sugar-sweetened beverages have too much sugar. Whole fruit in a developmentally-appropriate form (pureed, mashed, chopped, etc.) is a better choice.\n* Honey may contain botulism, which can make infants very ill.\n* Unpasteurized dairy products or juices, and raw or undercooked meats or eggs, which can be contaminated with harmful foodborne pathogens.\n* Added sugar and salt should be kept to a minimum so that your baby learns to like many different flavors and doesn\u2019t develop preferences for very sweet or salty foods.\n* Choking hazards such as whole nuts, grapes, popcorn, hot dogs, and hard candies should be avoided..",

    "content": "Regardless of whether infants are fed breast milk or formula, and continuing when they start solid foods, it\u2019s important that caregivers use a responsive feeding approach. Responsive feeding is grounded in 3 steps:2\n* The child signals hunger and satiety. This may occur through vocalizations (e.g., crying, talking), actions (e.g., pointing at food, or turning away when full), and facial expressions.\n* The caregiver recognizes the cues and responds promptly and appropriately. For example, if the baby seems hungry, he or she is offered food promptly. If the baby turns his or her head or pushes away the breast, bottle, or an offered bite of food, the caregiver does not pressure the baby to eat more.\n* The child experiences a predictable response to his or her signals.\nWith breastfeeding, responsive feeding simply means feeding the baby when he or she signals hunger, and the baby usually turns away, spits out the nipple, or falls asleep when full. With bottle-feeding, whether feeding breast milk or formula in a bottle, it\u2019s a little trickier. It\u2019s human nature to want the baby to finish the bottle that you\u2019ve prepared, but a responsive feeding approach means that you let the baby decide when he or she has had enough. Pressure to eat more can cause the baby to grow too fast in infancy, which is correlated with becoming overweight or obese later in childhood. When feeding solid foods, the same responsive feeding principles apply, although solids should be offered at predictable meal- and snack-times to avoid constant grazing throughout the day. If babies are offered appropriate, nutrient-dense foods, and fed responsively, parents generally don\u2019t need to worry about serving sizes or amounts eaten. They can trust that their babies will eat what they need.2\nThe best way to determine if children are getting enough food to eat is to track their growth. Pediatricians and other healthcare providers do this by measuring a child\u2019s weight, length, and head circumference at each check-up and plotting their measurements periodically on growth charts from the World Health Organization. Growth charts allow you to compare your child\u2019s growth to a population of other healthy children. Sometimes parents worry that if their child is in the 15th percentile for weight, that means she\u2019s not growing well, but this isn\u2019t the case. Children come in different shapes and sizes, and some grow faster than others. Thus, a child in the 15th percentile for weight may be a bit smaller than average, but when it comes to body size, the goal is not to be average or above average. The goal is to grow steadily and predictably in a way that is healthy for that individual child. If a child who was previously in the 15th percentile was suddenly measured at the 5th percentile or 50th percentile, that might indicate a health or nutrition problem that warrants further evaluation.7\nFigure 11.6.

    "content": "Toddlerhood represents a stage of growing independence for children. They gain the physical abilities to feed themselves confidently, and their growing language skills mean they can verbalize food preferences more clearly. Gradually, through exposure and experience, they learn to eat foods more and more like the rest of their family.8\nIn the toddler years, it\u2019s important to shift from a mindset of feeding \u201con demand,\u201d which is appropriate for infants, to one of predictable structure, with sit-down meals and snacks (usually three meals and two to three snacks each day). This prevents constant grazing and means that children come to the table hungry, ready to enjoy a nourishing meal. As much as you can, sit down to meals together so that your toddler learns that part of the joy of eating is enjoying time with loved ones.2,8\nThe AMDRs for children ages 1 to 3 recommend that 45 to 65 percent of calories come from carbohydrate, 30 to 40 percent from fat, and 5 to 20 percent from protein. Compared with older children and adults, this balance of macronutrients includes a higher level of fat to support young children\u2019s energy demands for growth and development. Therefore, fat or cholesterol generally should not be restricted in toddlers, although the focus should be on nutrient-dense sources of fat. Pediatricians usually recommend that toddlers ages 1 to 2 drink 2 to 3 cups of whole cow\u2019s milk per day to provide fat, protein, and micronutrients, including calcium and vitamin D. At age 2, parents can switch to low-fat or nonfat milk to reduce fat intake. For toddlers with a family history or other risk factors for obesity, pediatricians may recommend switching to low-fat milk sooner. It is important for toddlers to not over-consume cow\u2019s milk, as filling up on milk will reduce the consumption of other healthful foods. In particular, toddlers who drink too much cow\u2019s milk have a greater risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, which is a common nutrient for this age group and can cause deficits in brain development.8\nJust as for adults, MyPlate can be helpful for planning balanced meals for children 2 and up, with appropriate serving sizes. A ballpark recommendation for serving sizes for children ages 2 to 6 is about 1 tablespoon per year of age for each food, with additional food provided based on appetite.8\nOther recommendations for feeding toddlers include the following:2,8,9\n* Continuing to offer a variety of foods from all of the food groups, including a mix of vegetables and fruits of different colors, tastes, and textures.\n* Include whole grains and protein sources, such as poultry, fish, meats, tofu, or legumes in most meals and snacks.\n* Limit salty foods and sugary snacks for health reasons, and so that your child doesn\u2019t come to expect these tastes in foods.\n* By 12 to 15 months, wean toddlers from a bottle, transitioning to giving milk at meals in a cup. Prolonged bottle use tends to promote overconsumption of milk and can cause dental caries, particularly when toddlers fall asleep with a bottle.\n* Continue to take care with choking hazards, as many choking incidents happen in children younger than 4. Common choking hazards include hot dogs, hard candy, nuts, seeds, whole grapes, raw carrots, apples, popcorn, marshmallows, chewing gum, sausages, and globs of peanut butter. Ensuring that children are sitting down when eating can help to prevent choking accidents.\n* Stick to cow\u2019s milk and water as main beverage choices. Juice can be enjoyed occasionally in small servings (<0.5 cups/day) but is high in sugar, and whole fruit provides more nutrition. Plant-based beverages such as soy milk can be used in the case of a dairy allergy, lactose intolerance, or strong dietary preference, but be aware that these can be high in sugar and may not offer the same nutrients as cow\u2019s milk, so check labels carefully.",

Parents can best support their child\u2019s eating by providing the structure of family sit-down meals and snacks and modeling relaxed, enjoyable eating. The division of responsibility is an authoritative approach, providing structure and limits, but allowing the child autonomy within those limits. At meals and snack times, parents promote children\u2019s independence by allowing them to pick and choose foods from what has been made available and deciding how much of each to eat.\nAs your child learns to eat grown-up foods, every day will look slightly different\u2014some days eating a lot and other days eating very little. Don\u2019t cross the division of responsibility and pressure your child to eat more or less of something; this kind of pressure backfires.

    "content": "Eating competence is an evidence-based model that defines the interrelated spectrum of eating attitudes and behaviors.3 The model is based on the principle that internal cues of hunger, appetite, and satiety are reliable and can be used to inform food selection and guide energy balance and body weight. Satter breaks eating competence down into 4 basic components: (1) eating attitudes; (2) food acceptance attitudes and skills; (3) internal regulation attitudes and skills; and (4) contextual attitudes and skills for providing family meals.\nAccording to Ellyn Satter, \u201cEating Competence is being positive, comfortable, and flexible with eating as well as matter-of-fact and reliable about getting enough to eat of enjoyable food. Even though they don\u2019t worry about what and how much to eat, competent eaters do better nutritionally, are more active, sleep better, and have better lab tests. They are more self-aware and self-accepting, not only with food, but in all ways. To be a competent eater, be relaxed, self-trusting, and joyful about eating, and take good care of yourself with food.\u201d4\nCurrent nutrition advice often focuses on avoidance of foods and reliance on outside indicators, such as diet plans, to guide eating. Eating competence is the opposite. It encourages us to seek food that is enjoyable and to let internal processes such as hunger and satiety to guide eating.\nEating competence comprises both permission and discipline.5\n* Permission is choosing foods that are enjoyable and eating those foods in amounts that are satisfying, based on hunger, appetite, and satiety.\n* Discipline is providing the structure of regular meals and sit-down snacks, and paying attention to internal regulators while eating.\nIn \u201cSecrets of Feeding a Healthy Family: How to Eat, How to Raise Good Eaters, How to Cook,\u201d Satter discusses how the eating competence model is built on trust: \u201cTrust in our love of food and good eating; trust in following our inclinations to eat the food we like in amounts that are satisfying; trust that taking time to enjoy eating is time well-spent; trust that taking pleasure in eating supports being healthy; trust that behaving in such a self-respecting way is legitimate.\u201d\nToday\u2019s nutrition advice is often based on control\u2014the opposite of trust. Control is looking to outside instruction for what and how much to eat. It is sticking to a strict macro or calorie count; it is eating food because it is good for you (even though it is not appealing); it is eating a defined amount of food that is not related to hunger and satiety; and it is restricting food. Control often means restrained eating, and restrained eaters actually consume more food when exposed to forbidden foods.6 Also, when food choices are externally dictated, especially when promoting negative energy balance, the body\u2019s physiological and psychological defense mechanisms are activated, which can lead to gaining excess weight and accumulating excess fat after food restriction.7\nParents should consider their own eating competence as they work to build eating competence in their children. Do you feel positive about eating and about food? Do you enjoy eating a variety of foods and trying new foods? Do you trust your internal regulators of hunger, appetite, and satiety to guide how much you eat? Do you have structured meals and snacks? It\u2019s much more difficult to raise eating competent children if the adults in the family do not model a healthy relationship with food. Many new parents find that having children inspires them to work towards greater eating competence for themselves.\nMeal planning is a good place to start when working on building eating competence. Tips for meal planning:8\n* Start with what your family is currently eating, and cluster those foods into meals and snacks.\n* Try to provide food from each of the food groups for meals, and from 2 to 3 groups for snacks (dairy, fruit, vegetable, protein, and grain).",

The DRI recommendations divide adolescence into two age groups: 9 through 13 years, and 14 through 18 years. The onset of puberty brings a number of changes, including the development of the reproductive organs, the onset of menstruation in females, growth spurts, and changing body composition. Fat usually assumes a larger percentage of change in body weight in girls, while teenage boys experience greater muscle and bone development. All of these changes should be supported with sound nutrition.",

For ages 9 to 13, girls should consume about 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day, and boys should consume 1,600 to 2,600 calories per day. For ages 14 to 18, girls should consume about 1,800 to 2,400 calories per day, and boys should consume about 2,000 to 3,200 calories per day. Calorie needs vary based on activity level. The extra energy required for physical development during the teenage years should be obtained primarily from nutrient-dense foods instead of empty-calorie foods, to support adequate nutrient intake and a healthy body weight.\nFor children and adolescents ages 4 through 18, the AMDR for carbohydrates is 45 to 65 percent of daily calories, and most of these calories should come from high-fiber foods such as whole grains. The AMDR for protein is 10 to 30 percent of daily calories, and lean proteins, such as meat, poultry, fish, beans, nuts, and seeds are excellent ways to meet protein needs. The AMDR for fat is 25 to 35 percent of daily calories. The focus should be on unsaturated plant fats to prevent chronic diseases.",

Eating disorders stem from stress, low self-esteem, and other psychological and emotional issues. They are most prevalent among adolescent girls but have been increasing among adolescent boys in recent years. Because eating disorders often lead to malnourishment, adolescents with eating disorders are deprived of the crucial nutrients their still-growing bodies need. Girls with anorexia experience nutritional and hormonal problems that negatively influence peak bone density, and therefore may be at increased risk for osteoporosis and fracture throughout life.1 It is important for parents to watch for signs and symptoms of these disorders, including sudden weight loss, lethargy, vomiting after meals, and the use of appetite suppressants. Eating disorders can lead to serious complications or even be fatal if left untreated. Treatment includes cognitive, behavioral, and nutritional therapy.",

    "content": "Children need adequate caloric intake for growth, and it is important not to impose very restrictive diets. However, exceeding caloric requirements on a regular basis can lead to childhood obesity, which has become a major problem worldwide. According to the CDC National Center for Health Statistics, the prevalence of obesity was 18.4% for youth ages 6 to11 and 20.6% for youth ages 12 to 19 in 2106.2\nThere are a number of factors that may contribute to this problem, including:\n* early life factors, such as lack of breastfeeding support\n* larger portion sizes\n* limited access to nutrient-rich foods\n* increased access to fast foods and vending machines\n* declining physical education programs in schools\n* insufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle\n* media messages encouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods\nChildren who suffer from obesity are more likely to become overweight or obese adults. Obesity has a profound effect on self-esteem, energy, and activity level. Even more importantly, it is a major risk factor for a number of diseases later in life, including cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and certain cancers.3\nOne major contributing factor to childhood obesity is the consumption of added sugars, especially in the form of sugar sweetened beverages.4 Added sugars include not only sugar added to food at the table, but also ingredients in items such as bread, cookies, cakes, pies, jams, and soft drinks. In addition, sugars are often \u201chidden\u201d in items added to foods after they\u2019re prepared, such as ketchup, salad dressing, and other condiments. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, young children and adolescents consume an average of 362 calories per day from added sugars, or about 16% of daily calories, 10% more than what the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends.5 Adolescent boys (ages 12 to19 years) have the greatest intake of added sugar, averaging 442 calories. The primary offenders are processed and packaged foods, along with soda and other beverages. These foods are not only high in sugar, they are also light in terms of nutrients and often take the place of healthier options.\nIf a child gains weight inappropriate to growth, parents and caregivers should nurture eating competence and follow the division of responsibility as previously discussed in this unit. In addition, it is extremely beneficial to increase a child\u2019s physical activity and limit sedentary activities, such as watching television, playing video games, or surfing the Internet. Programs to address childhood obesity can include behavior modification, exercise counseling, psychological support or therapy, family counseling, and family meal-planning advice. For most, the goal is not weight loss, but rather allowing height to catch up with weight as the child continues to grow. Rapid weight loss is not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk of deficiencies and stunted growth.",

    "content": "One of the psychological and emotional changes that takes place during this life stage includes the desire for independence as adolescents develop individual identities apart from their families. One way that teenagers assert their independence is by choosing what to eat. They have their own money to purchase food and tend to eat more meals away from home. Too many poor choices can make young people nutritionally vulnerable.\nAt this life stage, young people still need the structure of family meals. Evidence shows that eating family meals is associated with nutritional benefits, including eating a diet with more fruits, vegetables, fiber, and micronutrients, and less fried food, soda, and saturated and trans fat.6",

A number of physiological and emotional changes take place during this life stage, and as they age, older adults can face a variety of health challenges. Blood pressure rises, and the immune system may have more difficulty battling invaders and infections. The skin becomes thinner and more wrinkled and may take longer to heal after injury. Older adults may gradually lose an inch or two in height. And short-term memory might not be as keen as it once was. However, many older adults remain in relatively good health and continue to be active into their golden years. Good nutrition is important to maintaining health later in life. In addition, the fitness and nutritional choices made earlier in life set the stage for continued health and happiness.\nAs noted in Unit 1, Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) vary based on age. Beginning at age 51, nutrient requirements for adults change in order to fit the nutritional issues and health challenges that older people face. Because the process of aging affects nutrient needs, some requirements for nutrients decrease as a person ages, while requirements for other nutrients increase. On this page, we will take a look at the changing nutrient requirements for older adults as well as some special concerns for the aging population.",

The decrease in physical activity that is typical of older adults also influences nutrition requirements. The AMDRs for carbohydrates, protein, and fat remain the same from middle age into old age. Older adults should substitute more unrefined carbohydrates, such as whole grains, for refined ones. Fiber is especially important in preventing constipation and diverticulitis, which is more common as people age, and it may also reduce the risk of colon cancer.

As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste. Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty, sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less appealing and decrease appetite. Intake of foods high in sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes toward food.

Stroke, which can damage the parts of the brain that control swallowing, is a common cause of dysphagia. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency. For example, solid foods can be pureed, ground, or chopped to allow more successful and safe swallowing. This decreases the risk of aspiration, which occurs when food flows into the respiratory tract and can result in pneumonia. Typically, speech therapists, physicians, and dietitians work together to determine the appropriate diet for dysphagia patients.",

Reduced muscle mass and physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per day to maintain a normal weight. Being overweight or obese increases the risk for potentially fatal conditions that can afflict older adults, particularly cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is also a contributing factor for a number of other conditions, including arthritis.\nFor older adults who are overweight or obese, dietary changes to promote weight loss should be combined with an exercise program to protect muscle mass. This is because dieting reduces muscle as well as fat, which can exacerbate the loss of muscle mass due to aging. Although weight loss among the elderly can be beneficial, it is best to be cautious and consult with a healthcare professional before beginning a weight loss program.",

A condition known as the anorexia of aging is characterized by poor food intake, which results in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls, muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. It is important for health care providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging, which can vary from one individual to another. Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can help healthcare professionals assess the risk factors associated with this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even reduced energy needs.\nNutrition interventions for anorexia of aging should focus primarily on a healthy diet. Remedies can include increasing the frequency and variety of meals and adding healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain pasta, and avocados) to the diet. The use of flavor enhancements with meals and oral nutrition supplements between meals may help to improve caloric intake.1 Health care professionals should consider a patient\u2019s habits and preferences when developing a nutrition treatment plan.

As a result, good nutrition today means optimal health tomorrow. Therefore, it is best to start making healthy choices from a young age and maintain them as you mature. However, research suggests that adopting good nutritional choices later in life, during the 40s, 50s, and even the 60s, may still help to reduce the risk of chronic disease as you grow older.3\nEven if past nutrition and lifestyle choices were not aligned with dietary guidelines, older adults can still do a great deal to reduce their risk of disability and chronic disease. There are a number of changes middle-aged adults can implement, even after years of unhealthy choices. Choices include eating more dark, green, leafy vegetables, choosing lean sources of protein such as lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts, and engaging in moderate physical activity for at least thirty minutes per day, several days per week. The resulting improvements will go a long way toward providing greater protection against falls and fractures, and helping to ward off cardiovascular disease and hypertension, among other chronic conditions.3\nFigure 11.7.
