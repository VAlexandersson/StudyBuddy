Course Description
This course introduces foundations of multimodal interaction methods and technologies addressing basic principles in human-centred design, embodied interaction, and human perception. Special emphasis is devoted to: • Evidence-based empirical methods for the study of human behavior in naturalistic interaction settings, and • Application of multimodal human interaction principles in visual and visuo-auditory design (e.g., as relevant in media, interfaces, imagery, immersion) The course will introduce students to the landscape of multimodality and human interaction from cognitive, formal modelling, computational, design, and empirical perspectives. Practical work will involve learning to conduct systematic multimodal analysis of human factors as relevant to interaction design.
